his mind, and before he answered rapped on the marble table with one of
the saucers.</p><p>"Bring my bottle of whiskey," he called out. He turned again to Philip. "I
keep my own bottle of whiskey. I can't afford to pay fifty centimes for
every thimbleful."</p><p>The waiter brought the bottle, and Cronshaw held it up to the light.</p><p>"They've been drinking it. Waiter, who's been helping himself to my
whiskey?"</p><p>"Mais personne, Monsieur Cronshaw."</p><p>"I made a mark on it last night, and look at it."</p><p>"Monsieur made a mark, but he kept on drinking after that. At that rate
Monsieur wastes his time in making marks."</p></div> </div>
