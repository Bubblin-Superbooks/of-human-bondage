tourist's passion for thoroughness.</p><p>"Nothing of the least consequence. You can come and look at them by
yourself with your Baedeker."</p><p>When they arrived at the Louvre Philip led his friend down the Long
Gallery.</p><p>"I should like to see The Gioconda," said Hayward.</p><p>"Oh, my dear fellow, it's only literature," answered Philip.</p><p>At last, in a small room, Philip stopped before The Lacemaker of Vermeer
van Delft.</p><p>"There, that's the best picture in the Louvre. It's exactly like a Manet."</p><p>With an expressive, eloquent thumb Philip expatiated on the charming work.
He used the jargon of the studios with overpowering effect.</p><p>"I don't know that I see anything so wonderful as all that in it," said
Hayward.</p></div> </div>
