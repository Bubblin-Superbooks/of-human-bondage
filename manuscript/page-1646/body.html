was a volume of an edition which had belonged to the Vicar of Blackstable.
It was a thin book bound in faded morocco, with a copperplate engraving as
a frontispiece; the pages were musty with age and stained with mould.
Philip, without meaning to, started forward a little as Doctor South took
the volume in his hands, and a slight smile came into his eyes. Very
little escaped the old doctor.</p><p>"Do I amuse you?" he asked icily.</p><p>"I see you're fond of books. You can always tell by the way people handle
them."</p><p>Doctor South put down the novel immediately.</p><p>"Breakfast at eight-thirty," he said and left the room.</p><p>"What a funny old fellow!" thought Philip.</p></div> </div>
