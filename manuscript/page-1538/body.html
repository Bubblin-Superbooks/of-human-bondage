Suddenly he caught sight of her eyes. There was deadly fear in them. It
was horrible to see. She was terrified. She wanted him to reassure her;
she looked at him pleadingly, not daring to ask for words of comfort but
with all her nerves astrung to receive them: he had none to offer her.</p><p>"I'm afraid you're very ill indeed," he said.</p><p>"What d'you think it is?"</p><p>When he told her she grew deathly pale, and her lips even turned, yellow.
she began to cry, hopelessly, quietly at first and then with choking sobs.</p><p>"I'm awfully sorry," he said at last. "But I had to tell you."</p><p>"I may just as well kill myself and have done with it."</p><p>He took no notice of the threat.</p><p>"Have you got any money?" he asked.</p><p>"Six or seven pounds."</p></div> </div>
