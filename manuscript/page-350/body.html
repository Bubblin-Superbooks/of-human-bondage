on which walking was a poor amusement. One evening when Philip had just
finished his German lesson with the Herr Professor and was standing for a
moment in the drawing-room, talking to Frau Erlin, Anna came quickly in.</p><p>"Mamma, where is Cacilie?" she said.</p><p>"I suppose she's in her room."</p><p>"There's no light in it."</p><p>The Frau Professor gave an exclamation, and she looked at her daughter in
