here, I didn't mean what you thought I meant, when you said you didn't
want me to be anything to you except just to cook and that sort of thing."</p><p>"Didn't you?" answered Philip, withdrawing his hand. "I did."</p><p>"Don't be such an old silly," she laughed.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>"I meant it quite seriously. I shouldn't have asked you to stay here on
any other condition."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"I feel I couldn't. I can't explain it, but it would spoil it all."</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>"Oh, very well, it's just as you choose. I'm not one to go down on my
hands and knees for that, and chance it."</p></div> </div>
