Foster, his uncle's housekeeper, so that she might communicate with him,
but still went once a week to the hospital on the chance of there being a
letter. One evening he saw his name on an envelope in a handwriting he had

memories. But at length, impatient with himself, he ripped open the
envelope.</p><p>7 William Street,
