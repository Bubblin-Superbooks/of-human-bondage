your proposal."</p><p>"Oh, don't talk rot. You will marry me, won't you?"</p><p>"D'you think we should be happy?"</p><p>"No. But what does that matter?"</p><p>The words were wrung out of him almost against his will. They surprised

day you said you couldn't afford it."</p><p>"I think I've got about fourteen hundred pounds left. Two can live just as
cheaply as one. That'll keep us till I'm qualified and have got through
with my hospital appointments, and then I can get an assistantship."</p><p>"It means you wouldn't be able to earn anything for six years. We should
have about four pounds a week to live on till then, shouldn't we?"</p><p>"Not much more than three. There are all my fees to pay."</p></div> </div>
