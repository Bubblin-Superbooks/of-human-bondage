family."</p><p>"I don't mind," she said.</p><p>Philip had spoken in jest. He merely wanted to kiss her, because he was
happy and he liked her and the night was so lovely.</p><p>"Good-night then," he said, with a little laugh, drawing her towards him.</p><p>She gave him her lips; they were warm and full and soft; he lingered a
little, they were like a flower; then, he knew not how, without meaning
it, he flung his arms round her. She yielded quite silently. Her body was
firm and strong. He felt her heart beat against his. Then he lost his
head. His senses overwhelmed him like a flood of rushing waters. He drew
her into the darker shadow of the hedge.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
