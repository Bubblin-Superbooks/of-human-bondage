know I don't like it."</p><p>Philip smiled a little, but his eyes were wild. He was silent for a while.
He looked at her sullenly. He hated, despised, and loved her.</p><p>"If I had an ounce of sense I'd never see you again," he said at last. "If
you only knew how heartily I despise myself for loving you!"</p><p>"That's not a very nice thing to say to me," she replied sulkily.</p><p>"It isn't," he laughed. "Let's go to the Pavilion."</p><p>"That's what's so funny in you, you start laughing just when one doesn't
expect you to. And if I make you that unhappy why d'you want to take me to
the Pavilion? I'm quite ready to go home."</p><p>"Merely because I'm less unhappy with you than away from you."</p><p>"I should like to know what you really think of me."</p><p>He laughed outright.</p></div> </div>
