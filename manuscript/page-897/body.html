I like you so much."</p><p>"Don't be idiotic," she said.</p><p>Philip took hold of her elbows and drew her towards him. She made no
resistance, but bent forward a little, and he kissed her red lips.</p><p>"Why did you do that?" she asked again.</p><p>"Because it's comfortable."</p><p>She did not answer, but a tender look came into her eyes, and she passed
her hand softly over his hair.</p><p>"You know, it's awfully silly of you to behave like this. We were such
good friends. It would be so jolly to leave it at that."</p><p>"If you really want to appeal to my better nature," replied Philip,
"you'll do well not to stroke my cheek while you're doing it."</p><p>She gave a little chuckle, but she did not stop.</p><p>"It's very wrong of me, isn't it?" she said.</p></div> </div>
