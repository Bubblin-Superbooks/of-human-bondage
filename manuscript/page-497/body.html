one or two portraits which she had painted, and to Philip's inexperience

a portfolio, drawing-paper, and charcoal.</p><p>"I shall be going to Amitrano's about nine tomorrow, and if you'll be
there then I'll see that you get a good place and all that sort of thing."</p><p>She asked him what he wanted to do, and Philip felt that he should not let
