one of the men who were waiting say to another that it was Mr. Gibbons. He
was middle-aged, short and corpulent, with a black beard and dark, greasy
hair. He had brisk movements and a clever face. He wore a silk hat and a
frock coat, the lapel of which was adorned with a white geranium
surrounded by leaves. He went into his office, leaving the door open; it
was very small and contained only an American roll-desk in the corner, a
bookcase, and a cupboard. The men standing outside watched him
mechanically take the geranium out of his coat and put it in an ink-pot
filled with water. It was against the rules to wear flowers in business.</p><p>During the day the department men who wanted to keep in with the governor
admired the flower.</p><p>"I've never seen better," they said, "you didn't grow it yourself?"</p><p>"Yes I did," he smiled, and a gleam of pride filled his intelligent eyes.</p></div> </div>
