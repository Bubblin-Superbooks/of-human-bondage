pictures, and walking through the garden he saw Fanny Price sitting in her
accustomed seat. He was sore at the rudeness with which she had met his
well-meant attempt to say something pleasant, and passed as though he had
not caught sight of her. But she got up at once and came towards him.</p><p>"Are you trying to cut me?" she said.</p><p>"No, of course not. I thought perhaps you didn't want to be spoken to."</p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p>"I wanted to have a look at the Manet, I've heard so much about it."</p><p>"Would you like me to come with you? I know the Luxembourg rather well. I
could show you one or two good things."</p><p>He understood that, unable to bring herself to apologise directly, she
made this offer as amends.</p></div> </div>
