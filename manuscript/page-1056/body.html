Griffiths' place and saw with his eyes, touched with his hands; he was
able to think himself in Griffiths' body, and he kissed her with his lips,
smiled at her with his smiling blue eyes. It was her emotion that
surprised him. He had never thought her capable of passion, and this was
passion: there was no mistaking it. Something seemed to give way in his
heart; it really felt to him as though something were breaking, and he
felt strangely weak.</p><p>"I don't want to make you unhappy. You needn't come away with me if you
don't want to. I'll give you the money all the same."</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>"No, I said I'd come, and I'll come."</p><p>"What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?"</p></div> </div>
