little girl was as fond of Philip as he was of her, and it was her great
pleasure every morning to crawl into his room (she was getting on for two

Mildred stopped this the poor child would cry bitterly. To Philip's

would think you was her father. I'm her mother, and I ought to know what's
good for her, oughtn't I?"</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Philip was exasperated by Mildred's stupidity; but he was so indifferent
to her now that it was only at times she made him angry. He grew used to
having her about. Christmas came, and with it a couple of days holiday</p></div> </div>
