that he was the only man in his parish who worked seven days a week.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The household got up half an hour earlier than usual. No lying abed for a
poor parson on the day of rest, Mr. Carey remarked as Mary Ann knocked at
the door punctually at eight. It took Mrs. Carey longer to dress, and she
got down to breakfast at nine, a little breathless, only just before her

were longer than usual, and the breakfast more substantial.</p></div> </div>
