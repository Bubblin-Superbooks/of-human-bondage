Mildred with too much of his society, and so had arranged that he should
not see her till dinner-time. She was ready when he fetched her, and he
chaffed her for her unwonted punctuality. She was wearing a new dress he
had given her. He remarked on its smartness.</p><p>"It'll have to go back and be altered," she said. "The skirt hangs all
wrong."</p><p>"You'll have to make the dressmaker hurry up if you want to take it to
Paris with you."</p></div> </div>
