treated as one of the family, sat reading in the parlour, Sally came in
and sat by the window to sew. The girls' clothes were made at home and
Sally could not afford to spend Sundays in idleness. Philip thought she
wished to talk and put down his book.</p><p>"Go on reading," she said. "I only thought as you were alone I'd come and
sit with you."</p><p>"You're the most silent person I've ever struck," said Philip.</p><p>"We don't want another one who's talkative in this house," she said.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">There was no irony in her tone: she was merely stating a fact. But it
suggested to Philip that she measured her father, alas, no longer the hero
he was to her childhood, and in her mind joined together his entertaining
conversation and the thriftlessness which often brought difficulties into
their life; she compared his rhetoric with her mother's practical common
sense;</p></div> </div>
