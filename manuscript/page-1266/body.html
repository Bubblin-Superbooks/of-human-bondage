that you should do exactly the same as the woman I have in does. Except
for that I don't want anything from you at all. I daresay you can cook
well enough for that."</p><p>She sprang to her feet and was about to come towards him.</p><p>"You are good to me, Philip."</p><p>"No, please stop where you are," he said hurriedly, putting out his hand
