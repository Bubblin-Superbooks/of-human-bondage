universal rule of action for all men."</p><p>"That seems to me perfect nonsense," said Philip.</p><p>"You're a bold man to say that of anything stated by Immanuel Kant,"
retorted Macalister.</p><p>"Why? Reverence for what somebody said is a stultifying quality: there's
a damned sight too much reverence in the world. Kant thought things not
because they were true, but because he was Kant."</p><p>"Well, what is your objection to the Categorical Imperative?" (They talked
as though the fate of empires were in the balance.)</p><p>"It suggests that one can choose one's course by an effort of will. And it
suggests that reason is the surest guide. Why should its dictates be any
better than those of passion? They're different. That's all."</p></div> </div>
