knew there was nothing which would give him more pleasure than Clutton's
praise. Clutton looked at the portrait for some time in silence, then
glanced at Philip's picture, which was standing on an easel.</p><p>"What's that?" he asked.</p><p>"Oh, I had a shot at a portrait too."</p><p>"The sedulous ape," he murmured.</p><p>He turned away again to Lawson's canvas. Philip reddened but did not
speak.</p><p>"Well, what d'you think of it?" asked Lawson at length.</p><p>"The modelling's jolly good," said Clutton. "And I think it's very well
drawn."</p><p>"D'you think the values are all right?"</p><p>"Quite."</p><p>Lawson smiled with delight. He shook himself in his clothes like a wet
dog.</p></div> </div>
