his final examination, he was qualified, and he had just been appointed
house-surgeon at a hospital in the North of London. He was taking up his

this was his last week in town, and he was determined to get as much
enjoyment into it as he could. He began to talk the gay nonsense which
Philip admired because he could not copy it. There was nothing much in
what he said, but his vivacity gave it point. There flowed from him a
force of life which affected everyone who knew him; it was almost as
sensible as bodily warmth. Mildred was more lively than Philip had ever

success. She was amusing herself enormously. She laughed louder and
louder. She quite forgot the genteel reserve</p></div> </div>
