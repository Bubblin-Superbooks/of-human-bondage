woman to wash the body while his uncle still lived, and he wondered why
Mrs. Foster had asked him to come. They would think he was in a great
hurry to kill the old man off. He thought the undertaker looked at him
oddly. He repeated the question. It irritated Philip. It was no business
of his.</p><p>"When did the Vicar pass away?"</p><p>Philip's first impulse was to say that it had just happened, but then it
would seem inexplicable if the sick man lingered for several hours. He
reddened and answered awkwardly.</p><p>"Oh, he isn't exactly dead yet."</p><p>The undertaker looked at him in perplexity, and he hurried to explain.</p><p>"Mrs. Foster is all alone and she wants a woman there. You understood,
don't you? He may be dead by now."</p></div> </div>
