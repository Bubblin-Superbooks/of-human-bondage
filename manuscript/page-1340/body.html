<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">came in yesterday afternoon, and I
didn't know which way to look. I saw her staring at them."</p><p>"What's the matter with them?"</p><p>"They're indecent. Disgusting, that's what I call it, to have drawings of
naked people about. And it isn't nice for baby either. She's beginning to
notice things now."</p><p>"How can you be so vulgar?"</p><p>"Vulgar? Modest, I call it. I've never said anything, but d'you think I
like having to look at those naked people all day long."</p><p>"Have you no sense of humour at all, Mildred?" he asked frigidly.</p><p>"I don't know what sense of humour's got to do with it. I've got a good
mind to take them down myself. If you want to know what I think about
them, I think they're disgusting."</p><p>"I don't want to know what you think about them, and I forbid you to touch
them."</p></div> </div>
