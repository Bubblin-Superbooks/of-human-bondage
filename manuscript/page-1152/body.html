unimportant. The fear of it should never influence a single action of the
wise man. I know that I shall die struggling for breath, and I know that
I shall be horribly afraid. I know that I shall not be able to keep myself
from regretting bitterly the life that has brought me to such a pass; but
I disown that regret. I now, weak, old, diseased, poor, dying, hold still
my soul in my hands, and I regret nothing."</p><p>"D'you remember that Persian carpet you gave me?" asked Philip.</p><p>Cronshaw smiled his old, slow smile of past days.</p><p>"I told you that it would give you an answer to your question when you
asked me what was the meaning of life. Well, have you discovered the
answer?"</p><p>"No," smiled Philip. "Won't you tell it me?"</p><p>"No, no, I can't do that. The answer is meaningless unless you discover it
for yourself."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
