day-nurse and night-nurse all in one."</p><p>"It's very kind of you, but I shan't want anything," said Philip.</p><p>Griffiths put his hand on Philip's forehead, a large cool, dry hand, and
the touch seemed to him good.</p><p>"I'm just going to take this round to the dispensary to have it made up,
and then I'll come back."</p><p>In a little while he brought the medicine and gave Philip a dose. Then he
went upstairs to fetch his books.</p><p>"You won't mind my working in your room this afternoon, will you?" he
said, when he came down. "I'll leave the door open so that you can give me
a shout if you want anything."</p><p>Later in the day Philip, awaking from an uneasy doze, heard voices in his
sitting-room. A friend had come in to see Griffiths.</p><p>"I say, you'd better not come in tonight," he heard Griffiths saying.</p></div> </div>
