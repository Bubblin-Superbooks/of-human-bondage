A woman servant came into a room\nin which a child was sleeping and drew the curtains. She glanced\nmechanically at the house opposite, a stucco house with a portico, and\nwent to the child's bed.</p><p>\"Wake up, Philip,\" she said.</p><p>She pulled down the bed-clothes, took him in her arms, and carried him\ndownstairs. He was only half awake.</p><p>\"Your mother wants you,\" she said.</p>",
  "page-10": "<p>She opened the door of a room on the floor below and took the child over\nto a bed in which a woman was lying. It was his mother. She stretched out\nher arms, and the child nestled by her side. He did not ask why he had\nbeen awakened. The woman kissed his eyes, and with thin, small hands felt\nthe warm body through his white flannel nightgown. She pressed him closer\nto herself.</p><p>\"Are you sleepy, darling?\" she said.</p><p>Her voice was so weak that it seemed to come already from a great\ndistance. The child did not answer, but smiled comfortably. He was very\nhappy in the large, warm bed, with those soft arms about him. He tried to\nmake himself smaller still as he cuddled up against his mother, and he\nkissed her sleepily. In a moment he closed his eyes and was fast asleep.\nThe doctor came forwards and stood by the bed-side.</p><p>\"Oh, don't take him away yet,\" she moaned.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The doctor, without answering, looked at her</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">gravely. Knowing she would\nnot be allowed to keep the child much longer, the woman kissed him again;\nand she passed her hand down his body till she came to his feet; she held\nthe right foot in her hand and felt the five small toes; and then slowly\npassed her hand over the left one. She gave a sob.</p><p>\"What's the matter?\" said the doctor. \"You're tired.\"</p><p>She shook her head, unable to speak, and the tears rolled down her cheeks.\nThe doctor bent down.</p><p>\"Let me take him.\"</p><p>She was too weak to resist his wish, and she gave the child up. The doctor\nhanded him back to his nurse.</p><p>\"You'd better put him back in his own bed.\"</p><p>\"Very well, sir.\" The little boy, still sleeping, was taken away. His\nmother sobbed now broken-heartedly.</p><p>\"What will happen to him, poor child?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The monthly nurse tried to quiet her, and presently, from exhaustion, the\ncrying ceased.

  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to a table on the other side of the room,\nupon which, under a towel, lay the body of a still-born child. He lifted\nthe towel and looked. He was hidden from the bed by a screen, but the\nwoman guessed what he was doing.</p><p>\"Was it a girl or a boy?\" she whispered to the nurse.</p><p>\"Another boy.\"</p><p>The woman did not answer. In a moment the child's nurse came back. She\napproached the bed.</p><p>\"Master Philip never woke up,\" she said. There was a pause. Then the\ndoctor felt his patient's pulse once more.</p><p>\"I don't think there's anything I can do just now,\" he said. \"I'll call\nagain after breakfast.\"</p><p>\"I'll show you out, sir,\" said the child's nurse.</p><p>They walked downstairs in silence.

He was an only child and used to\namusing himself. The room was filled with massive furniture, and on each\nof the sofas were three big cushions. There was a cushion too in each\narm-chair. All these he had taken and, with the help of the gilt rout\nchairs, light and easy to move, had made an elaborate cave in which he\ncould hide himself from the Red Indians who were lurking behind the\ncurtains. He put his ear to the floor and listened to the herd of\nbuffaloes</p>",
  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that raced across the prairie. Presently, hearing the door open,\nhe held his breath so that he might not be discovered; but a violent hand\npulled away a chair and the cushions fell down.</p><p>\"You naughty boy, Miss Watkin WILL be cross with you.\"</p><p>\"Hulloa, Emma!\" he said.</p><p>The nurse bent down and kissed him, then began to shake out the cushions,\nand put them back in their places.</p><p>\"Am I to come home?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Yes, I've come to fetch you.\"</p><p>\"You've got a new dress on.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was in eighteen-eighty-five, and she wore a bustle.

The question she had expected did not come,</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and so she could\nnot give the answer she had prepared.</p><p>\"Aren't you going to ask how your mamma is?\" she said at length.</p><p>\"Oh, I forgot.

Emma was a tall, big-boned woman, with fair hair and large features.\nShe came from Devonshire and, notwithstanding her many years of service in\nLondon, had never lost the breadth of her accent. Her tears increased her\nemotion, and she pressed the little boy to her heart. She felt vaguely the\npity of</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that child deprived of the only love in the world that is quite\nunselfish. It seemed dreadful that he must be handed over to strangers.\nBut in a little while she pulled herself together.</p><p>\"Your Uncle William is waiting in to see you,\" she said. \"Go and say\ngood-bye to Miss Watkin, and we'll go home.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to say good-bye,\" he answered, instinctively anxious to hide\nhis tears.</p><p>\"Very well, run upstairs and get your hat.\"</p><p>He fetched it, and when he came down Emma was waiting for him in the hall.\nHe heard the sound of voices in the study behind the dining-room. He\npaused. He knew that Miss Watkin and her sister were talking to friends,\nand it seemed to him—he was nine years old—that if he went in they would\nbe sorry for him.</p><p>\"I think I'll go and say good-bye to Miss Watkin.\"</p><p>\"I think you'd better,\" said Emma.</p>",
  "page-18": "<p>\"Go in and tell them I'm coming,\" he said.</p><p>He wished to make the most of his opportunity. Emma knocked at the door\nand walked in. He heard her speak.</p><p>\"Master Philip wants to say good-bye to you, miss.\"</p><p>There was a sudden hush of the conversation, and Philip limped in.\nHenrietta Watkin was a stout woman, with a red face and dyed hair. In\nthose days to dye the hair excited comment, and Philip had heard much\ngossip at home when his godmother's changed colour. She lived with an\nelder sister, who had resigned herself contentedly to old age. Two ladies,\nwhom Philip did not know, were calling, and they looked at him curiously.</p><p>\"My poor child,\" said Miss Watkin, opening her arms.</p><p>She began to cry. Philip understood now why she had not been in to\nluncheon and why she wore a black dress. She could not speak.</p>",
  "page-19": "<p>\"I've got to go home,\" said Philip, at last.</p><p>He disengaged himself from Miss Watkin's arms, and she kissed him again.\nThen he went to her sister and bade her good-bye too. One of the strange\nladies asked if she might kiss him, and he gravely gave her permission.\nThough crying, he keenly enjoyed the sensation he was causing; he would\nhave been glad to stay a little longer to be made much of, but felt they\nexpected him to go, so he said that Emma was waiting for him. He went out\nof the room. Emma had gone downstairs to speak with a friend in the\nbasement, and he waited for her on the landing. He heard Henrietta\nWatkin's voice.</p><p>\"His mother was my greatest friend. I can't bear to think that she's\ndead.\"</p><p>\"You oughtn't to have gone to the funeral, Henrietta,\" said her sister. \"I\nknew it would upset you.\"</p><p>Then one of the strangers spoke.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Poor little boy, it's dreadful to think of him quite</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">alone in the world.\nI see he limps.\"</p><p>\"Yes, he's got a club-foot. It was such a grief to his mother.\"</p><p>Then Emma came back. They called a hansom, and she told the driver where\nto go.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-21": "<h3>Iii.</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">When they reached the house Mrs. Carey had died in—it was in a dreary,\nrespectable street between Notting Hill Gate and High Street,\nKensington—Emma led Philip into the drawing-room. His uncle was writing\nletters of thanks for the wreaths which had been sent. One of them, which\nhad arrived too late for the funeral, lay in its cardboard box on the\nhall-table.</p><p>\"Here's Master Philip,\" said Emma.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mr. Carey stood up slowly and shook hands with the little boy. Then on\nsecond thoughts he bent down</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and kissed his forehead. He was a man of\nsomewhat less than average height, inclined to corpulence, with his hair,\nworn long, arranged over the scalp so as to conceal his baldness. He was\nclean-shaven. His features were regular, and it was possible to imagine\nthat in his youth he had been good-looking. On his watch-chain he wore a\ngold cross.</p><p>\"You're going to live with me now, Philip,\" said Mr. Carey. \"Shall you\nlike that?\"</p><p>Two years before Philip had been sent down to stay at the vicarage after\nan attack of chicken-pox; but there remained with him a recollection of an\nattic and a large garden rather than of his uncle and aunt.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"You must look upon me and your Aunt Louisa as your father and mother.\"</p><p>The child's mouth trembled a little, he reddened, but did not answer.</p>",
  "page-23": "<p>\"Your dear mother left you in my charge.\"</p><p>Mr. Carey had no great ease in expressing himself. When the news came that\nhis sister-in-law was dying, he set off at once for London, but on the way\nthought of nothing but the disturbance in his life that would be caused if\nher death forced him to undertake the care of her son. He was well over\nfifty, and his wife, to whom he had been married for thirty years, was\nchildless; he did not look forward with any pleasure to the presence of a\nsmall boy who might be noisy and rough. He had never much liked his\nsister-in-law.</p><p>\"I'm going to take you down to Blackstable tomorrow,\" he said.</p><p>\"With Emma?\"</p><p>The child put his hand in hers, and she pressed it.</p><p>\"I'm afraid Emma must go away,\" said Mr. Carey.</p><p>\"But I want Emma to come with me.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip began to cry, and the nurse could not help</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">crying too. Mr. Carey\nlooked at them helplessly.</p><p>\"I think you'd better leave me alone with Master Philip for a moment.\"</p><p>\"Very good, sir.\"</p><p>Though Philip clung to her, she released herself gently. Mr. Carey took\nthe boy on his knee and put his arm round him.</p><p>\"You mustn't cry,\" he said. \"You're too old to have a nurse now. We must\nsee about sending you to school.\"</p><p>\"I want Emma to come with me,\" the child repeated.</p><p>\"It costs too much money, Philip. Your father didn't leave very much, and\nI don't know what's become of it. You must look at every penny you spend.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mr. Carey had called the day before on the family solicitor. Philip's\nfather was a surgeon in good practice, and his hospital appointments\nsuggested an established position; so that it was a surprise on his sudden\ndeath from blood-poisoning to find that he had left his</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">widow little more\nthan his life insurance and what could be got for the lease of their house\nin Bruton Street. This was six months ago; and Mrs. Carey, already in\ndelicate health, finding herself with child, had lost her head and\naccepted for the lease the first offer that was made. She stored her\nfurniture, and, at a rent which the parson thought outrageous, took a\nfurnished house for a year, so that she might suffer from no inconvenience\ntill her child was born. But she had never been used to the management of\nmoney, and was unable to adapt her expenditure to her altered\ncircumstances. The little she had slipped through her fingers in one way\nand another, so that now, when all expenses were paid, not much more than\ntwo thousand pounds remained to support the boy till he was able to earn\nhis own living. It was impossible to explain all this to Philip and he was\nsobbing still.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You'd better go to Emma,\" Mr. Carey said, feeling</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that she could console\nthe child better than anyone.</p><p>Without a word Philip slipped off his uncle's knee, but Mr. Carey stopped\nhim.</p><p>\"We must go tomorrow, because on Saturday I've got to prepare my sermon,\nand you must tell Emma to get your things ready today. You can bring all\nyour toys. And if you want anything to remember your father and mother by\nyou can take one thing for each of them. Everything else is going to be\nsold.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The boy slipped out of the room. Mr. Carey was unused to work, and he\nturned to his correspondence with resentment. On one side of the desk was\na bundle of bills, and these filled him with irritation. One especially\nseemed preposterous. Immediately after Mrs. Carey's death Emma had ordered\nfrom the florist masses of white flowers for the room in which the dead\nwoman lay. It was sheer waste of money. Emma took far too much upon\nherself. Even if there had been no</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">financial necessity, he would have\ndismissed her.</p><p>But Philip went to her, and hid his face in her bosom, and wept as though\nhis heart would break. And she, feeling that he was almost her own\nson—she had taken him when he was a month old—consoled him with soft\nwords. She promised that she would come and see him sometimes, and that\nshe would never forget him; and she told him about the country he was\ngoing to and about her own home in Devonshire—her father kept a turnpike\non the high-road that led to Exeter, and there were pigs in the sty, and\nthere was a cow, and the cow had just had a calf—till Philip forgot his\ntears and grew excited at the thought of his approaching journey.\nPresently she put him down, for there was much to be done, and he helped\nher to lay out his clothes on the bed. She sent him into the nursery to\ngather up his toys, and in a little while he was playing happily.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But at last he grew tired of being alone and went</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">back to the bed-room, in\nwhich Emma was now putting his things into a big tin box; he remembered\nthen that his uncle had said he might take something to remember his\nfather and mother by. He told Emma and asked her what he should take.</p><p>\"You'd better go into the drawing-room and see what you fancy.\"</p><p>\"Uncle William's there.\"</p><p>\"Never mind that. They're your own things now.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip went downstairs slowly and found the door open. Mr. Carey had left\nthe room. Philip walked slowly round. They had been in the house so short\na time that there was little in it that had a particular interest to him.\nIt was a stranger's room, and Philip saw nothing that struck his fancy.\nBut he knew which were his mother's things and which belonged to the\nlandlord, and presently fixed on a little clock that he had once heard his\nmother say she liked. With this he walked</p>",
  "page-29": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">again rather disconsolately\nupstairs. Outside the door of his mother's bed-room he stopped and\nlistened. Though no one had told him not to go in, he had a feeling that\nit would be wrong to do so; he was a little frightened, and his heart beat\nuncomfortably; but at the same time something impelled him to turn the\nhandle. He turned it very gently, as if to prevent anyone within from\nhearing, and then slowly pushed the door open. He stood on the threshold\nfor a moment before he had the courage to enter. He was not frightened\nnow, but it seemed strange. He closed the door behind him. The blinds were\ndrawn, and the room, in the cold light of a January afternoon, was dark.\nOn the dressing-table were Mrs. Carey's brushes and the hand mirror. In a\nlittle tray were hairpins. There was a photograph of himself on the\nchimney-piece and one of his father. He had often been in the room when\nhis mother was not in it, but now it seemed different. There was</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">something\ncurious in the look of the chairs. The bed was made as though someone were\ngoing to sleep in it that night, and in a case on the pillow was a\nnight-dress.</p><p>Philip opened a large cupboard filled with dresses and, stepping in, took\nas many of them as he could in his arms and buried his face in them. They\nsmelt of the scent his mother used. Then he pulled open the drawers,\nfilled with his mother's things, and looked at them: there were lavender\nbags among the linen, and their scent was fresh and pleasant. The\nstrangeness of the room left it, and it seemed to him that his mother had\njust gone out for a walk. She would be in presently and would come\nupstairs to have nursery tea with him. And he seemed to feel her kiss on\nhis lips.</p><p>It was not true that he would never see her again. It was not true simply\nbecause it was impossible. He climbed up on the bed and put his head on\nthe pillow. He lay there quite still.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

The traffic of the house took place through a\nside-door, and there was a back door as well for the gardener and for\nbeggars and tramps. It was a fairly large house of yellow brick, with a\nred roof, built about five and twenty years before in an ecclesiastical\nstyle.

She had a shy manner and a gentle voice.</p><p>\"Did you walk, William?\" she said, almost reproachfully, as she kissed her\nhusband.</p><p>\"I didn't think of it,\" he answered, with a glance at his nephew.</p><p>\"It didn't hurt you to walk, Philip, did it?\" she asked the child.</p><p>\"No. I always walk.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He was a little surprised at their conversation.

  "page-34": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">polished pine, with a\npeculiar smell, and had been put in because fortunately, when the church\nwas reseated, enough wood remained over.

  "page-35": "<p>Aunt Louisa took Philip upstairs and showed him into a tiny bed-room that\nlooked out on the drive.

Then Henry Carey married a\npatient, a beautiful girl but penniless, an orphan with no near relations,\nbut of good family; and there was an array of fine friends at the wedding.\nThe parson, on his visits to her when he came to London, held himself with\nreserve. He felt shy with her and in his heart he resented her great\nbeauty: she dressed more magnificently than became the wife of a\nhardworking surgeon; and the charming furniture of her house, the flowers\namong which she lived even in winter, suggested an extravagance which he\ndeplored. He heard her talk of entertainments she was going to; and, as he\ntold his wife on getting home again, it was impossible to</p>",
  "page-42": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">accept\nhospitality without making some return. He had seen grapes in the\ndining-room that must have cost at least eight shillings a pound; and at\nluncheon he had been given asparagus two months before it was ready in the\nvicarage garden. Now all he had anticipated was come to pass: the Vicar\nfelt the satisfaction of the prophet who saw fire and brimstone consume\nthe city which would not mend its way to his warning. Poor Philip was\npractically penniless, and what was the good of his mother's fine friends\nnow? He heard that his father's extravagance was really criminal, and it\nwas a mercy that Providence had seen fit to take his dear mother to\nitself: she had no more idea of money than a child.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When Philip had been a week at Blackstable an incident happened which\nseemed to irritate his uncle very much. One morning he found on the\nbreakfast table a small packet which had been sent on by post</p>",
  "page-43": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">from the\nlate Mrs. Carey's house in London. It was addressed to her. When the\nparson opened it he found a dozen photographs of Mrs. Carey. They showed\nthe head and shoulders only, and her hair was more plainly done than\nusual, low on the forehead, which gave her an unusual look; the face was\nthin and worn, but no illness could impair the beauty of her features.\nThere was in the large dark eyes a sadness which Philip did not remember.\nThe first sight of the dead woman gave Mr. Carey a little shock, but this\nwas quickly followed by perplexity. The photographs seemed quite recent,\nand he could not imagine who had ordered them.</p><p>\"D'you know anything about these, Philip?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I remember mamma said she'd been taken,\" he answered. \"Miss Watkin\nscolded her.... She said: I wanted the boy to have something to remember\nme by when he grows up.\"</p>",
  "page-44": "<p>Mr. Carey looked at Philip for an instant. The child spoke in a clear\ntreble. He recalled the words, but they meant nothing to him.</p><p>\"You'd better take one of the photographs and keep it in your room,\" said\nMr. Carey. \"I'll put the others away.\"</p><p>He sent one to Miss Watkin, and she wrote and explained how they came to\nbe taken.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One day Mrs. Carey was lying in bed, but she was feeling a little better\nthan usual, and the doctor in the morning had seemed hopeful; Emma had\ntaken the child out, and the maids were downstairs in the basement:\nsuddenly Mrs. Carey felt desperately alone in the world. A great fear\nseized her that she would not recover from the confinement which she was\nexpecting in a fortnight. Her son was nine years old. How could he be\nexpected to remember her? She could not bear to think that he would grow\nup and forget, forget her</p>",
  "page-45": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">utterly; and she had loved him so passionately,\nbecause he was weakly and deformed, and because he was her child. She had\nno photographs of herself taken since her marriage, and that was ten years\nbefore. She wanted her son to know what she looked like at the end. He\ncould not forget her then, not forget utterly. She knew that if she called\nher maid and told her she wanted to get up, the maid would prevent her,\nand perhaps send for the doctor, and she had not the strength now to\nstruggle or argue. She got out of bed and began to dress herself. She had\nbeen on her back so long that her legs gave way beneath her, and then the\nsoles of her feet tingled so that she could hardly bear to put them to the\nground. But she went on. She was unused to doing her own hair and, when\nshe raised her arms and began to brush it, she felt faint. She could never\ndo it as her maid did. It was beautiful hair, very fine, and of a deep\nrich gold. Her eyebrows were straight and dark. She put on a black</p>",
  "page-46": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">skirt,\nbut chose the bodice of the evening dress which she liked best: it was of\na white damask which was fashionable in those days. She looked at herself\nin the glass. Her face was very pale, but her skin was clear: she had\nnever had much colour, and this had always made the redness of her\nbeautiful mouth emphatic. She could not restrain a sob. But she could not\nafford to be sorry for herself; she was feeling already desperately tired;\nand she put on the furs which Henry had given her the Christmas\nbefore—she had been so proud of them and so happy then—and slipped\ndownstairs with beating heart. She got safely out of the house and drove\nto a photographer. She paid for a dozen photographs. She was obliged to\nask for a glass of water in the middle of the sitting; and the assistant,\nseeing she was ill, suggested that she should come another day, but she\ninsisted on staying till the end. At last it was finished, and she drove\nback again to the dingy little house in Kensington</p>",
  "page-47": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which she hated with\nall her heart. It was a horrible house to die in.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She found the front door open, and when she drove up the maid and Emma ran\ndown the steps to help her. They had been frightened when they found her\nroom empty. At first they thought she must have gone to Miss Watkin, and\nthe cook was sent round. Miss Watkin came back with her and was waiting\nanxiously in the drawing-room. She came downstairs now full of anxiety and\nreproaches; but the exertion had been more than Mrs. Carey was fit for,\nand when the occasion for firmness no longer existed she gave way. She\nfell heavily into Emma's arms and was carried upstairs. She remained\nunconscious for a time that seemed incredibly long to those that watched\nher, and the doctor, hurriedly sent for, did not come. It was next day,\nwhen she was a little better, that Miss Watkin got some explanation out of\nher. Philip was playing on the floor</p>",

Mr. Carey shared it\nwith two neighbours. He had it from ten till one, when the gardener took\nit over to Mr. Ellis at the Limes, with whom it remained till seven; then\nit was taken to Miss Brooks at the Manor House, who, since she got it\nlate, had the advantage of keeping it. In summer Mrs. Carey, when she was\nmaking jam, often asked her for a copy to cover the pots with. When the\nVicar settled down to his paper his wife put on her bonnet and went out to\ndo the shopping.</p>",
  "page-50": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Philip accompanied her. Blackstable was a fishing\nvillage. It consisted of a high street in which were the shops, the bank,\nthe doctor's house, and the houses of two or three coalship owners; round\nthe little harbor were shabby streets in which lived fishermen and poor\npeople; but since they went to chapel they were of no account. When Mrs.\nCarey passed the dissenting ministers in the street she stepped over to\nthe other side to avoid meeting them, but if there was not time for this\nfixed her eyes on the pavement. It was a scandal to which the Vicar had\nnever resigned himself that there were three chapels in the High Street:\nhe could not help feeling that the law should have stepped in to prevent\ntheir erection. Shopping in Blackstable was not a simple matter; for\ndissent, helped by the fact that the parish church was two miles from the\ntown, was very common; and it was necessary to deal only with churchgoers;\nMrs. Carey knew perfectly that the</p>",
  "page-51": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">vicarage custom might make all the\ndifference to a tradesman's faith. There were two butchers who went to\nchurch, and they would not understand that the Vicar could not deal with\nboth of them at once; nor were they satisfied with his simple plan of\ngoing for six months to one and for six months to the other. The butcher\nwho was not sending meat to the vicarage constantly threatened not to come\nto church, and the Vicar was sometimes obliged to make a threat: it was\nvery wrong of him not to come to church, but if he carried iniquity\nfurther and actually went to chapel, then of course, excellent as his meat\nwas, Mr. Carey would be forced to leave him for ever. Mrs. Carey often\nstopped at the bank to deliver a message to Josiah Graves, the manager,\nwho was choir-master, treasurer, and churchwarden. He was a tall, thin man\nwith a sallow face and a long nose; his hair was very white, and to Philip\nhe seemed extremely old. He kept the parish</p>",
  "page-52": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">accounts, arranged the treats\nfor the choir and the schools; though there was no organ in the parish\nchurch, it was generally considered (in Blackstable) that the choir he led\nwas the best in Kent; and when there was any ceremony, such as a visit\nfrom the Bishop for confirmation or from the Rural Dean to preach at the\nHarvest Thanksgiving, he made the necessary preparations. But he had no\nhesitation in doing all manner of things without more than a perfunctory\nconsultation with the Vicar, and the Vicar, though always ready to be\nsaved trouble, much resented the churchwarden's managing ways. He really\nseemed to look upon himself as the most important person in the parish.\nMr. Carey constantly told his wife that if Josiah Graves did not take care\nhe would give him a good rap over the knuckles one day; but Mrs. Carey\nadvised him to bear with Josiah Graves: he meant well, and it was not his\nfault if he was not quite a gentleman. The Vicar,</p>",
  "page-53": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">finding his comfort in\nthe practice of a Christian virtue, exercised forbearance; but he revenged\nhimself by calling the churchwarden Bismarck behind his back.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Once there had been a serious quarrel between the pair, and Mrs. Carey\nstill thought of that anxious time with dismay. The Conservative candidate\nhad announced his intention of addressing a meeting at Blackstable; and\nJosiah Graves, having arranged that it should take place in the Mission\nHall, went to Mr. Carey and told him that he hoped he would say a few\nwords. It appeared that the candidate had asked Josiah Graves to take the\nchair. This was more than Mr. Carey could put up with. He had firm views\nupon the respect which was due to the cloth, and it was ridiculous for a\nchurchwarden to take the chair at a meeting when the Vicar was there. He\nreminded Josiah Graves that parson meant person, that is, the vicar was\nthe person of the parish. Josiah Graves answered that he was the first</p>",
  "page-54": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">to\nrecognise the dignity of the church, but this was a matter of politics,\nand in his turn he reminded the Vicar that their Blessed Saviour had\nenjoined upon them to render unto Caesar the things that were Caesar's. To\nthis Mr. Carey replied that the devil could quote scripture to his\npurpose, himself had sole authority over the Mission Hall, and if he were\nnot asked to be chairman he would refuse the use of it for a political\nmeeting. Josiah Graves told Mr. Carey that he might do as he chose, and\nfor his part he thought the Wesleyan Chapel would be an equally suitable\nplace. Then Mr. Carey said that if Josiah Graves set foot in what was\nlittle better than a heathen temple he was not fit to be churchwarden in\na Christian parish. Josiah Graves thereupon resigned all his offices, and\nthat very evening sent to the church for his cassock and surplice. His\nsister, Miss Graves, who kept house for him, gave up her secretaryship of\nthe Maternity Club, which provided</p>",
  "page-55": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the pregnant poor with flannel, baby\nlinen, coals, and five shillings. Mr. Carey said he was at last master in\nhis own house. But soon he found that he was obliged to see to all sorts\nof things that he knew nothing about; and Josiah Graves, after the first\nmoment of irritation, discovered that he had lost his chief interest in\nlife. Mrs. Carey and Miss Graves were much distressed by the quarrel; they\nmet after a discreet exchange of letters, and made up their minds to put\nthe matter right: they talked, one to her husband, the other to her\nbrother, from morning till night; and since they were persuading these\ngentlemen to do what in their hearts they wanted, after three weeks of\nanxiety a reconciliation was effected. It was to both their interests, but\nthey ascribed it to a common love for their Redeemer. The meeting was held\nat the Mission Hall, and the doctor was asked to be chairman. Mr. Carey\nand Josiah Graves both made speeches.</p>",
  "page-56": "<p>When Mrs. Carey had finished her business with the banker, she generally\nwent upstairs to have a little chat with his sister; and while the ladies\ntalked of parish matters, the curate or the new bonnet of Mrs. Wilson—Mr.\nWilson was the richest man in Blackstable, he was thought to have at least\nfive hundred a year, and he had married his cook—Philip sat demurely in\nthe stiff parlour, used only to receive visitors, and busied himself with\nthe restless movements of goldfish in a bowl.

  "page-58": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">enough to accompany\nthe old-fashioned songs she had sung for thirty years.

Mrs. Carey seldom ate more than bread and butter, with a\nlittle stewed fruit to follow, but the Vicar had a slice of cold meat.\nImmediately after supper Mrs. Carey rang the bell for prayers, and then\nPhilip went to bed. He rebelled against being undressed by Mary Ann and\nafter a while succeeded in establishing his right to dress and undress\nhimself. At nine o'clock Mary Ann brought in the eggs and the plate.

Mary\nAnn had her bath in the kitchen on Monday night, because she liked to\nbegin the week clean. Uncle William could not have his on Saturday,\nbecause he had a heavy day before him and he was always a little tired\nafter a bath, so he had it on Friday. Mrs. Carey had hers on Thursday for\nthe same reason. It looked as though Saturday were naturally indicated for\nPhilip, but Mary Ann said she couldn't keep the fire up on Saturday night:\nwhat with all the cooking on Sunday, having to make pastry and she didn't\nknow what all, she did not feel up to giving the boy his bath on Saturday\nnight; and it was quite clear that he could not bath himself.

This settled it. Mary Ann said\nshe was quite sure he wouldn't bath himself properly, and rather than he\nshould go dirty—and not because he was going into the presence of the\nLord, but because she couldn't abide a boy who wasn't properly\nwashed—she'd work herself to the bone even if it was Saturday night.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

They were about to step into the carriage\nwhen the Vicar remembered that no one had given him his egg.

Haphazard among the sermons and\nhomilies, the travels, the lives of the Saints, the Fathers, the histories\nof the church, were old-fashioned novels; and these Philip at last\ndiscovered. He chose them by their titles, and the first he read was The\nLancashire Witches, and then he read The Admirable Crichton, and then\nmany more.

The house opposite was taken for six weeks by a gentleman\nwho had two little boys, and he sent in to ask if Philip would like to go\nand play with them; but Mrs. Carey returned a polite refusal.

Boys were encouraged there to\naspire to Holy Orders, and the education was such as might prepare an\nhonest lad to spend his life in God's service.

This consisted of a large, long room at opposite ends of which two\nunder-masters conducted the second and third forms, and of a smaller one,\nleading out of it, used by Mr. Watson, who taught the first form. To\nattach the preparatory to the senior school these three classes were known\nofficially, on speech days and in reports, as upper, middle, and lower\nsecond. Philip was put in the last. The master, a red-faced man with a\npleasant voice, was called Rice; he had</p>",

Philip was surprised when it was a quarter to eleven\nand they were let out for ten minutes' rest.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The whole school rushed noisily into the play-ground. The new boys were\ntold to go into the middle, while the others stationed themselves along\nopposite walls. They began to play Pig in the Middle. The old boys ran\nfrom wall to wall while the new boys tried to catch them: when one was\nseized and the mystic words said—one, two, three, and a pig for me—he\nbecame a prisoner and, turning sides, helped to catch those who were still\nfree. Philip saw a boy running past and tried to catch him, but his limp\ngave him no chance; and the runners, taking their opportunity, made\nstraight for the ground he covered. Then one of them had the brilliant\nidea of imitating Philip's clumsy run. Other boys saw it and began to\nlaugh; then they all copied the first; and they ran round Philip, limping\ngrotesquely, screaming</p>",
  "page-109": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">in their treble voices with shrill laughter. They\nlost their heads with the delight of their new amusement, and choked with\nhelpless merriment. One of them tripped Philip up and he fell, heavily as\nhe always fell, and cut his knee. They laughed all the louder when he got\nup. A boy pushed him from behind, and he would have fallen again if\nanother had not caught him. The game was forgotten in the entertainment of\nPhilip's deformity. One of them invented an odd, rolling limp that struck\nthe rest as supremely ridiculous, and several of the boys lay down on the\nground and rolled about in laughter: Philip was completely scared. He\ncould not make out why they were laughing at him. His heart beat so that\nhe could hardly breathe, and he was more frightened than he had ever been\nin his life. He stood still stupidly while the boys ran round him,\nmimicking and laughing; they shouted to him to try and catch them; but he\ndid not move. He did not want them to see him run any</p>",

Philip's knee\nwas bleeding, and he was dusty and dishevelled. For some minutes Mr. Rice\ncould not control his form. They were excited still by the strange\nnovelty, and Philip saw one or two of them furtively looking down at his\nfeet. He tucked them under the bench.</p><p>In the afternoon they went up to play football, but Mr. Watson stopped\nPhilip on the way out after dinner.</p><p>\"I suppose you can't play football, Carey?\" he asked him.</p><p>Philip blushed self-consciously.</p><p>\"No, sir.\"</p><p>\"Very well. You'd better go up to the field. You can walk as far as that,\ncan't you?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip had no idea where the field was, but he</p>",
  "page-111": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">answered all the same.</p><p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p><p>The boys went in charge of Mr. Rice, who glanced at Philip and seeing he\nhad not changed, asked why he was not going to play.</p><p>\"Mr. Watson said I needn't, sir,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>There were boys all round him, looking at him curiously, and a feeling of\nshame came over Philip.

You had to push your nib with the finger-nail so as to\nget the point of it over your opponent's, while he manoeuvred to prevent\nthis and to get the point of his nib over the back of yours; when this\nresult was achieved you breathed on the ball</p>",

Philip had been very adroit, and it was with a heavy heart\nthat he gave up his winning; but his fingers itched to play still, and a\nfew days later, on his way to the football field, he went into a shop and\nbought a pennyworth of J pens. He carried them loose in his pocket and\nenjoyed feeling them. Presently Singer found out that he had them. Singer\nhad given up his nibs too, but he had kept back a very large one, called\na Jumbo, which was almost unconquerable, and he could not resist the\nopportunity of getting Philip's Js out of him.

The idea came to him that he must do something more than\nusual to attract the attention of God, and he turned back the rug which\nwas in front of his bed so that he could kneel on the bare boards; and\nthen it struck him that his nightshirt was a softness that might displease\nhis Maker, so he took it off and said his prayers naked. When he got into\nbed he was so cold that for some time he could not sleep, but when he did,\nit was so soundly that Mary</p>",
  "page-141": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Ann had to shake him when she brought in his\nhot water next morning. She talked to him while she drew the curtains, but\nhe did not answer; he had remembered at once that this was the morning for\nthe miracle. His heart was filled with joy and gratitude. His first\ninstinct was to put down his hand and feel the foot which was whole now,\nbut to do this seemed to doubt the goodness of God. He knew that his foot\nwas well. But at last he made up his mind, and with the toes of his right\nfoot he just touched his left.

He was appealing unconsciously to gods\nolder to his race than the God of Israel. And he bombarded the Almighty\nwith his prayer, at odd times of the day, whenever it occurred to him, in\nidentical words always, for it seemed to him important to make his request\nin the same terms.

But Mr. Gordon had only escaped the\ncountry living by the skin of his teeth, and he had never hit a boy since.\nThe right the masters possessed to cane boys on the hand was taken away\nfrom them, and Squirts could no longer emphasize his anger by beating his\ndesk with the cane.

Now and\nthen it made him restless to be with people and he wanted urgently to be\nalone. He set out for solitary walks into the country.

  "page-188": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">not why, to wander along its banks.

There was a colony of rooks in the great elms, and they\nfilled the air with melancholy cries. Along one side lay the Cathedral\nwith its great central tower, and Philip, who knew as yet nothing of\nbeauty, felt when he looked at it a troubling delight which he could not\nunderstand. When he had a study (it was a little square room looking on a\nslum, and four boys shared it), he bought a photograph of that view of the\nCathedral, and pinned it up over his desk. And he found himself taking a\nnew</p>",
  "page-189": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">interest in what he saw from the window of the Fourth Form room. It\nlooked on to old lawns, carefully tended, and fine trees with foliage\ndense and rich.

And when he came\nto the quiet little meetings in his house he was prepared to surrender\nhimself entirely. He kept his eyes fixed on Mr. Perkins' shining eyes, and\nsat with mouth half open, his head a little thrown forward so as to miss\nno word.

  "page-195": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But Philip thought over all that the headmaster had said, and presently,\nhis mind taken up entirely with the ceremony that was before him, a\nmystical rapture seized him.

He wanted to surrender\nhimself entirely to the service of God, and he made up his mind definitely\nthat he would be ordained. When the great day arrived, his soul deeply\nmoved by all the preparation, by the books he had studied and above all by\nthe overwhelming influence of the head, he could hardly contain himself\nfor fear and joy. One thought had tormented him. He knew that he would\nhave to walk alone through the chancel, and he dreaded showing his limp\nthus obviously, not only to the whole school, who were attending the\nservice, but also to the strangers, people from the city or parents who\nhad come to see their sons</p>",

  "page-199": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">regarded him with active dislike. The\nhumiliations he suffered when first he went to school had caused in him a\nshrinking from his fellows which he could never entirely overcome; he\nremained shy and silent.

These from his distance he admired\nextravagantly; and though he was inclined to be more sarcastic with them\nthan with others, though he made little jokes at their expense, he would\nhave given anything to change places with them. Indeed he would gladly\nhave changed places with the dullest boy in the school who was whole of\nlimb. He took to a singular habit. He would imagine that he was some boy\nwhom he had a particular fancy for; he would throw his soul, as it were,\ninto the other's body, talk with his voice and laugh with his heart; he\nwould imagine himself doing all the things the other</p>",

  "page-201": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">terms, welcomed him coldly. It made him\nnervous to feel himself an intruder; but he had learned to hide his\nfeelings, and they found him quiet and unobtrusive. With Rose, because he\nwas as little able as anyone else to resist his charm, Philip was even\nmore than usually shy and abrupt; and whether on account of this,\nunconsciously bent upon exerting the fascination he knew was his only by\nthe results, or whether from sheer kindness of heart, it was Rose who\nfirst took Philip into the circle. One day, quite suddenly, he asked\nPhilip if he would walk to the football field with him. Philip flushed.</p><p>\"I can't walk fast enough for you,\" he said.</p><p>\"Rot. Come on.\"</p><p>And just before they were setting out some boy put his head in the\nstudy-door and asked Rose to go with him.</p><p>\"I can't,\" he answered. \"I've already promised Carey.\"</p>",

  "page-203": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that\nfilled him; but presently his distrust of the fates gave way before a wild\nhappiness. He thought Rose the most wonderful fellow he had ever seen.

Rose's friends used\nto come in to tea in the study sometimes or sit about when there was\nnothing better to do—Rose liked a crowd and the chance of a rag—and they\nfound that Philip was quite a decent fellow. Philip was happy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When the last day of term came he and Rose arranged by which train they\nshould come back, so that they might meet at the station and have tea in\nthe town before returning to school.

He brooded over the end to their\nfriendship and fancied that others were talking of it. In his\nsensitiveness he saw sneers and wonderings in other fellows' manner when\nthey were not bothering their heads with him at all.

He spoke with the\nsuspicion of a cockney accent. He was one of those boys who are too slack\nto play games, and he exercised great ingenuity in making excuses to avoid\nsuch as were compulsory. He was regarded by boys and masters with a vague\ndislike, and it was from arrogance that Philip now sought his society.\nSharp in a couple of terms was going to Germany for a year. He hated\nschool, which he looked upon as an indignity to be endured till he was old\nenough to go out into the world.

He hated to have quarrelled with him, and now that he saw he had\ngiven him pain he was very sorry. But at the moment he had not been master\nof himself. It seemed that some devil had seized him, forcing him to say\nbitter things against his will, even though at the time he wanted to shake\nhands with Rose and meet him more than halfway. The desire to wound had\nbeen too strong for him. He had wanted to revenge himself for the pain and\nthe humiliation he had endured.

Then Philip thought of the two services every Sunday at\nBlackstable. The church was bare and cold, and there was a smell all about\none of pomade and starched clothes. The curate preached once and his uncle\npreached once. As he grew up he had learned to know his uncle; Philip was\ndownright and intolerant, and he could not understand that a man might\nsincerely say things as a clergyman which he never acted up to as a man.\nThe deception outraged him.

Then there was the Vicar of Ferne, a bearded, fine figure of\na man: his wife had been forced to leave him because of his cruelty, and\nshe had filled the neighbourhood with stories of his immorality. The Vicar\nof Surle, a tiny hamlet by the sea, was to be seen every evening in the\npublic house a stone's throw from his vicarage; and the</p>",

He could not conceal his exultation.</p><p>\"Is it true that you're very anxious to leave?\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p><p>\"Are you unhappy here?\"</p><p>Philip blushed. He hated instinctively any attempt to get into the depths\nof his feelings.</p><p>\"Oh, I don't know, sir.\"</p><p>Mr. Perkins, slowly dragging his fingers through his beard, looked at him\nthoughtfully.

  "page-244": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">holes are all round, and\nwhatever shape the pegs are they must wedge in somehow. One hasn't time to\nbother about anything but the average.\" Then suddenly he addressed himself\nto Philip: \"Look here, I've got a suggestion to make to you. It's getting\non towards the end of the term now. Another term won't kill you, and if\nyou want to go to Germany you'd better go after Easter than after\nChristmas. It'll be much pleasanter in the spring than in midwinter. If at\nthe end of the next term you still want to go I'll make no objection. What\nd'you say to that?\"</p><p>\"Thank you very much, sir.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip was so glad to have gained the last three months that he did not\nmind the extra term. The school seemed less of a prison when he knew that\nbefore Easter he would be free from it for ever. His heart danced within\nhim. That evening in chapel he looked round at the boys, standing\naccording to their forms, each in his</p>",
  "page-245": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">due place, and he chuckled with\nsatisfaction at the thought that soon he would never see them again. It\nmade him regard them almost with a friendly feeling. His eyes rested on\nRose. Rose took his position as a monitor very seriously: he had quite an\nidea of being a good influence in the school; it was his turn to read the\nlesson that evening, and he read it very well. Philip smiled when he\nthought that he would be rid of him for ever, and it would not matter in\nsix months whether Rose was tall and straight-limbed; and where would the\nimportance be that he was a monitor and captain of the eleven? Philip\nlooked at the masters in their gowns. Gordon was dead, he had died of\napoplexy two years before, but all the rest were there. Philip knew now\nwhat a poor lot they were, except Turner perhaps, there was something of\na man in him; and he writhed at the thought of the subjection in which\nthey had held him. In six months they would not matter either.</p>",
  "page-246": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Their\npraise would mean nothing to him, and he would shrug his shoulders at\ntheir censure.</p><p>Philip had learned not to express his emotions by outward signs, and\nshyness still tormented him, but he had often very high spirits; and then,\nthough he limped about demurely, silent and reserved, it seemed to be\nhallooing in his heart. He seemed to himself to walk more lightly. All\nsorts of ideas danced through his head, fancies chased one another so\nfuriously that he could not catch them; but their coming and their going\nfilled him with exhilaration. Now, being happy, he was able to work, and\nduring the remaining weeks of the term set himself to make up for his long\nneglect. His brain worked easily, and he took a keen pleasure in the\nactivity of his intellect. He did very well in the examinations that\nclosed the term. Mr. Perkins made only one remark: he was talking to him\nabout an essay he had written, and, after the usual criticisms, said:</p>",
  "page-247": "<p>\"So you've made up your mind to stop playing the fool for a bit, have\nyou?\"</p><p>He smiled at him with his shining teeth, and Philip, looking down, gave an\nembarrassed smile.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The half dozen boys who expected to divide between them the various prizes\nwhich were given at the end of the summer term had ceased to look upon\nPhilip as a serious rival, but now they began to regard him with some\nuneasiness. He told no one that he was leaving at Easter and so was in no\nsense a competitor, but left them to their anxieties. He knew that Rose\nflattered himself on his French, for he had spent two or three holidays in\nFrance; and he expected to get the Dean's Prize for English essay; Philip\ngot a good deal of satisfaction in watching his dismay when he saw how\nmuch better Philip was doing in these subjects than himself. Another\nfellow, Norton, could not go to Oxford unless he got one of the\nscholarships at the</p>",
  "page-248": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">disposal of the school. He asked Philip if he was\ngoing in for them.</p><p>\"Have you any objection?\" asked Philip.</p><p>It entertained him to think that he held someone else's future in his\nhand. There was something romantic in getting these various rewards\nactually in his grasp, and then leaving them to others because he\ndisdained them. At last the breaking-up day came, and he went to Mr.\nPerkins to bid him good-bye.</p><p>\"You don't mean to say you really want to leave?\"</p><p>Philip's face fell at the headmaster's evident surprise.</p><p>\"You said you wouldn't put any objection in the way, sir,\" he answered.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I thought it was only a whim that I'd better humour. I know you're\nobstinate and headstrong. What on earth d'you want to leave for now?\nYou've only got another term in any case. You can get the Magdalen\nscholarship easily; you'll get half the prizes we've got to</p>",
  "page-249": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">give.\"</p><p>Philip looked at him sullenly. He felt that he had been tricked; but he\nhad the promise, and Perkins would have to stand by it.</p><p>\"You'll have a very pleasant time at Oxford. You needn't decide at once\nwhat you're going to do afterwards. I wonder if you realise how delightful\nthe life is up there for anyone who has brains.\"</p><p>\"I've made all my arrangements now to go to Germany, sir,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"Are they arrangements that couldn't possibly be altered?\" asked Mr.\nPerkins, with his quizzical smile. \"I shall be very sorry to lose you. In\nschools the rather stupid boys who work always do better than the clever\nboy who's idle, but when the clever boy works—why then, he does what\nyou've done this term.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip flushed darkly. He was unused to compliments, and no one had ever\ntold him he was</p>",
  "page-250": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">clever.

He was\ntouched and immensely flattered. It would be pleasant to end up his\nschool-days with glory and then go to Oxford: in a flash there appeared\nbefore him the life which he had heard described from boys who came back\nto play in the O.K.S. match or in letters from the University read out in\none of the studies. But he was ashamed; he would look such a fool in his\nown eyes if he gave in now; his uncle would chuckle at the</p>",
  "page-251": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">success of the\nheadmaster's ruse. It was rather a come-down from the dramatic surrender\nof all these prizes which were in his reach, because he disdained to take\nthem, to the plain, ordinary winning of them. It only required a little\nmore persuasion, just enough to save his self-respect, and Philip would\nhave done anything that Mr. Perkins wished; but his face showed nothing of\nhis conflicting emotions. It was placid and sullen.</p><p>\"I think I'd rather go, sir,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Perkins, like many men who manage things by their personal influence,\ngrew a little impatient when his power was not immediately manifest.

He did\nnot want to go, but he knew he could never bring himself to go to the\nheadmaster and tell him he would stay. That was a humiliation he could\nnever put upon himself.

The service\nwas conducted, with a great clattering of plates, by the same clumsy lout\nwho had opened the door for him; and though he was quick it happened that\nthe first persons to be served had finished before the last had received\ntheir appointed portions. The Frau Professor insisted that nothing but\nGerman should be spoken, so that Philip, even if his bashfulness had\npermitted him to be talkative, was forced to hold his tongue.

The doctor had two daughters, but they were\nboth much older than Philip and had been married to successive assistants\nwhile Philip was still a small boy.

In\ncourse of time he became an authority on art and</p>",
  "page-297": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">literature. He came under\nthe influence of Newman's Apologia; the picturesqueness of the Roman\nCatholic faith appealed to his esthetic sensibility; and it was only the\nfear of his father's wrath (a plain, blunt man of narrow ideas, who read\nMacaulay) which prevented him from 'going over.' When he only got a pass\ndegree his friends were astonished; but he shrugged his shoulders and\ndelicately insinuated that he was not the dupe of examiners.

He was also a good deal in debt: it\nwas difficult to live in London like a gentleman on three hundred a year;\nand his heart yearned for the Venice and Florence which John Ruskin had so\nmagically described.

  "page-320": "<h3>Xxviii.</h3><p class=\" stretch-last-line start-chapter\">It occurred neither to Hayward nor to Weeks that the conversations which\nhelped them to pass an idle evening were being turned over afterwards in\nPhilip's active brain. It had never struck him before that religion was a\nmatter upon which discussion was possible. To him it meant the Church of\nEngland, and not to believe in its tenets was a sign of wilfulness which\ncould not fail of punishment here or hereafter. There was some doubt in\nhis mind about the chastisement of unbelievers. It was possible that a\nmerciful judge, reserving the flames of hell for the heathen—Mahommedans,\nBuddhists,</p>",
  "page-321": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and the rest—would spare Dissenters and Roman Catholics\n(though at the cost of how much humiliation when they were made to realise\ntheir error!), and it was also possible that He would be pitiful to those\nwho had had no chance of learning the truth,—this was reasonable enough,\nthough such were the activities of the Missionary Society there could not\nbe many in this condition—but if the chance had been theirs and they had\nneglected it (in which category were obviously Roman Catholics and\nDissenters), the punishment was sure and merited. It was clear that the\nmiscreant was in a parlous state. Perhaps Philip had not been taught it in\nso many words, but certainly the impression had been given him that only\nmembers of the Church of England had any real hope of eternal happiness.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One of the things that Philip had heard definitely stated was that the\nunbeliever was a wicked and a vicious man; but Weeks, though he believed\nin hardly</p>",
  "page-322": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">anything that Philip believed, led a life of Christian purity.\nPhilip had received little kindness in his life, and he was touched by the\nAmerican's desire to help him: once when a cold kept him in bed for three\ndays, Weeks nursed him like a mother. There was neither vice nor\nwickedness in him, but only sincerity and loving-kindness. It was\nevidently possible to be virtuous and unbelieving.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Also Philip had been given to understand that people adhered to other\nfaiths only from obstinacy or self-interest: in their hearts they knew\nthey were false; they deliberately sought to deceive others. Now, for the\nsake of his German he had been accustomed on Sunday mornings to attend the\nLutheran service, but when Hayward arrived he began instead to go with him\nto Mass. He noticed that, whereas the Protestant church was nearly empty\nand the congregation had a listless air, the Jesuit on the other hand was\ncrowded and the</p>",
  "page-323": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">worshippers seemed to pray with all their hearts. They had\nnot the look of hypocrites. He was surprised at the contrast; for he knew\nof course that the Lutherans, whose faith was closer to that of the Church\nof England, on that account were nearer the truth than the Roman\nCatholics. Most of the men—it was largely a masculine congregation—were\nSouth Germans; and he could not help saying to himself that if he had been\nborn in South Germany he would certainly have been a Roman Catholic. He\nmight just as well have been born in a Roman Catholic country as in\nEngland; and in England as well in a Wesleyan, Baptist, or Methodist\nfamily as in one that fortunately belonged to the church by law\nestablished. He was a little breathless at the danger he had run. Philip\nwas on friendly terms with the little Chinaman who sat at table with him\ntwice each day. His name was Sung. He was always smiling, affable, and\npolite. It seemed strange that he should</p>",
  "page-324": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">frizzle in hell merely because he\nwas a Chinaman; but if salvation was possible whatever a man's faith was,\nthere did not seem to be any particular advantage in belonging to the\nChurch of England.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip, more puzzled than he had ever been in his life, sounded Weeks. He\nhad to be careful, for he was very sensitive to ridicule; and the\nacidulous humour with which the American treated the Church of England\ndisconcerted him. Weeks only puzzled him more. He made Philip acknowledge\nthat those South Germans whom he saw in the Jesuit church were every bit\nas firmly convinced of the truth of Roman Catholicism as he was of that of\nthe Church of England, and from that he led him to admit that the\nMahommedan and the Buddhist were convinced also of the truth of their\nrespective religions. It looked as though knowing that you were right\nmeant nothing; they all knew they were right. Weeks had no intention</p>",
  "page-325": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of\nundermining the boy's faith, but he was deeply interested in religion, and\nfound it an absorbing topic of conversation. He had described his own\nviews accurately when he said that he very earnestly disbelieved in almost\neverything that other people believed. Once Philip asked him a question,\nwhich he had heard his uncle put when the conversation at the vicarage had\nfallen upon some mildly rationalistic work which was then exciting\ndiscussion in the newspapers.</p><p>\"But why should you be right and all those fellows like St. Anselm and St.\nAugustine be wrong?\"</p><p>\"You mean that they were very clever and learned men, while you have grave\ndoubts whether I am either?\" asked Weeks.</p><p>\"Yes,\" answered Philip uncertainly, for put in that way his question\nseemed impertinent.</p><p>\"St. Augustine believed that the earth was flat and that the sun turned\nround it.\"</p>",
  "page-326": "<p>\"I don't know what that proves.\"</p><p>\"Why, it proves that you believe with your generation.

It took his breath away like a plunge into cold water. He\nlooked at Weeks with startled eyes. Suddenly he felt afraid. He left Weeks\nas quickly as he could. He wanted to be alone. It was the most startling\nexperience that he had ever had. He tried to think it all out; it was very\nexciting, since his whole life seemed concerned (he thought his decision\non this matter must profoundly affect its course) and a mistake might lead\nto eternal damnation; but the more he reflected the more convinced he was;\nand though during the next few weeks he read books, aids to scepticism,\nwith eager interest it was only to confirm him in what he felt\ninstinctively.

It was a matter of\nenvironment and example. A new environment and a new example gave him the\nopportunity to find himself. He put off the faith of his childhood quite\nsimply, like a cloak that he no longer needed. At first life seemed\nstrange and lonely without the belief which, though he never realised it,\nhad been an unfailing support. He felt like a man who has leaned on a\nstick and finds himself forced suddenly to walk without assistance. It\nreally seemed as though the days were colder and the nights more solitary.\nBut he was upheld by the excitement; it seemed to make life a more\nthrilling adventure; and in a little while the stick which he had thrown\naside, the cloak which had fallen from his shoulders, seemed an\nintolerable burden of which he had been eased.

He was unduly pleased with himself. With youth's lack of\nsympathy for an attitude other than its own he despised not a little Weeks\nand Hayward</p>",
  "page-330": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">because they were content with the vague emotion which they\ncalled God and would not take the further step which to himself seemed so\nobvious. One day he went alone up a certain hill so that he might see a\nview which, he knew not why, filled him always with wild exhilaration. It\nwas autumn now, but often the days were cloudless still, and then the sky\nseemed to glow with a more splendid light: it was as though nature\nconsciously sought to put a fuller vehemence into the remaining days of\nfair weather. He looked down upon the plain, a-quiver with the sun,\nstretching vastly before him: in the distance were the roofs of Mannheim\nand ever so far away the dimness of Worms. Here and there a more piercing\nglitter was the Rhine. The tremendous spaciousness of it was glowing with\nrich gold.

Suddenly he realised that he had lost also\nthat burden of responsibility which made every action of his life a matter\nof urgent consequence. He could breathe more freely in a lighter air.

And sometimes, as\nthough the influence of innumerable ancestors, Godfearing and devout, were\nworking in him unconsciously, there seized him a panic fear that perhaps\nafter all it was all true, and there was, up there behind the blue sky, a\njealous God who would punish in everlasting flames the atheist.

Their rapid movement apart\nsuggested that they had been walking arm in arm. Philip was puzzled and\nsurprised. He had never paid much attention to Fraulein Cacilie. She was\na plain girl, with a square face and blunt features. She could not have\nbeen more than sixteen, since she still wore her long fair hair in a\nplait.

The Frau Professor charged\nhim three marks a bottle and made a good profit. None of her other guests\ndrank wine, and some of them did not even drink beer. Neither did she wish\nto lose Fraulein Cacilie, whose parents were in business in South America\nand paid well for the Frau Professor's motherly care; and she knew that if\nshe wrote to the girl's uncle, who lived in Berlin, he would immediately\ntake her away. The Frau Professor contented herself with giving them both\nsevere looks at table and, though she dared not be rude to the Chinaman,\ngot a certain satisfaction out of incivility to Cacilie. But the three\nelderly ladies were not content.

It was plain that they did not care what was said of them. At last\neven the placidity of Professor Erlin was moved, and he insisted that his\nwife should speak to the Chinaman.

  "page-355": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">panic seized her; for Professor Erlin with\nbrutal frankness had suggested the possible consequences of an intrigue\nwhich was now manifest to everyone, and she saw her good name in\nHeidelberg and the repute of her house ruined by a scandal which could not\npossibly be hidden. For some reason, blinded perhaps by her interests,\nthis possibility had never occurred to her; and now, her wits muddled by\na terrible fear, she could hardly be prevented from turning the girl out\nof the house at once.

He could not\nsupport the thought of a Teutonic merry-making.

Though much under\nHayward's influence, he would not grant that indecision pointed to a\ncharming sensitiveness; and he resented the shadow of a sneer with which\nHayward looked upon his straight ways. They corresponded. Hayward was an\nadmirable letter-writer, and knowing his talent took pains with his\nletters. His temperament was receptive to the beautiful influences with\nwhich he came in contact, and he was able in his letters from Rome to put\na subtle fragrance of Italy. He thought the city of the ancient Romans a\nlittle vulgar, finding distinction only in the decadence of the Empire;\nbut the Rome of the Popes appealed to his sympathy, and in his chosen\nwords, quite exquisitely, there appeared a rococo beauty. He wrote of old\nchurch music and the Alban Hills, and of the languor of incense and the\ncharm of the streets by night, in the rain, when the pavements</p>",
  "page-361": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">shone and\nthe light of the street lamps was mysterious. Perhaps he repeated these\nadmirable letters to various friends. He did not know what a troubling\neffect they had upon Philip; they seemed to make his life very humdrum.\nWith the spring Hayward grew dithyrambic. He proposed that Philip should\ncome down to Italy. He was wasting his time at Heidelberg. The Germans\nwere gross and life there was common; how could the soul come to her own\nin that prim landscape? In Tuscany the spring was scattering flowers\nthrough the land, and Philip was nineteen; let him come and they could\nwander through the mountain towns of Umbria. Their names sang in Philip's\nheart. And Cacilie too, with her lover, had gone to Italy. When he thought\nof them Philip was seized with a restlessness he could not account for. He\ncursed his fate because he had no money to travel, and he knew his uncle\nwould not send him more than the fifteen pounds a month which had</p>",
  "page-362": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">been\nagreed upon. He had not managed his allowance very well. His pension and\nthe price of his lessons left him very little over, and he had found going\nabout with Hayward expensive. Hayward had often suggested excursions, a\nvisit to the play, or a bottle of wine, when Philip had come to the end of\nhis month's money; and with the folly of his age he had been unwilling to\nconfess he could not afford an extravagance.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Luckily Hayward's letters came seldom, and in the intervals Philip settled\ndown again to his industrious life. He had matriculated at the university\nand attended one or two courses of lectures. Kuno Fischer was then at the\nheight of his fame and during the winter had been lecturing brilliantly on\nSchopenhauer. It was Philip's introduction to philosophy. He had a\npractical mind and moved uneasily amid the abstract; but he found an\nunexpected fascination in listening to metaphysical disquisitions; they\nmade him breathless; it</p>",
  "page-363": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was a little like watching a tight-rope dancer\ndoing perilous feats over an abyss; but it was very exciting. The\npessimism of the subject attracted his youth; and he believed that the\nworld he was about to enter was a place of pitiless woe and of darkness.\nThat made him none the less eager to enter it; and when, in due course,\nMrs. Carey, acting as the correspondent for his guardian's views,\nsuggested that it was time for him to come back to England, he agreed with\nenthusiasm.

If he left\nHeidelberg at the end of July they could talk things over during August,\nand it would be a good time to make arrangements.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The date of his departure was settled, and Mrs. Carey wrote to him again.\nShe reminded him of Miss Wilkinson, through whose kindness he had gone to\nFrau Erlin's house at Heidelberg, and told him that she had arranged to\nspend a few weeks with them at</p>",
  "page-364": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Blackstable.

Philip was a little puzzled when\nhe mentioned this afterwards to Aunt Louisa, and she told him that when\nshe knew the Wilkinsons they had never had anything more than a pony and\na dog-cart; Aunt Louisa had heard of the rich uncle, but as he was married\nand had children before Emily was born she could never have had much hope\nof inheriting his fortune. Miss Wilkinson had little good to say of\nBerlin, where she was now in a situation.

  "page-375": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">many. She had\nbeen governess in the family of a fashionable portrait-painter, who had\nmarried a Jewish wife of means, and in their house she had met many\ndistinguished people. She dazzled Philip with their names. Actors from the\nComedie Francaise had come to the house frequently, and Coquelin, sitting\nnext her at dinner, had told her he had never met a foreigner who spoke\nsuch perfect French. Alphonse Daudet had come also, and he had given her\na copy of Sappho: he had promised to write her name in it, but she had\nforgotten to remind him. She treasured the volume none the less and she\nwould lend it to Philip. Then there was Maupassant. Miss Wilkinson with a\nrippling laugh looked at Philip knowingly. What a man, but what a writer!\nHayward had talked of Maupassant, and his reputation was not unknown to\nPhilip.</p><p>\"Did he make love to you?\" he asked.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The words seemed to stick funnily in his throat, but</p>",
  "page-376": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he asked them\nnevertheless.

It was a habit that he could not break himself of.\"</p><p>She sighed a little, and seemed to look back tenderly on the past.</p><p>\"He was a charming man,\" she murmured.</p><p>A greater experience than Philip's would have guessed from these words the\nprobabilities of the encounter: the distinguished writer invited to\nluncheon en famille, the governess coming in sedately with the two tall\ngirls she was teaching; the introduction:</p><p>\"Notre Miss Anglaise.\"</p><p>\"Mademoiselle.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And the luncheon during which the Miss Anglaise sat silent while the\ndistinguished writer talked to his</p>",

She loved the boulevards and the Bois. There\nwas grace in every street, and the trees in the Champs Elysees had a\ndistinction which trees had not elsewhere. They were sitting on a stile\nnow by the high-road, and Miss Wilkinson looked with disdain upon the\nstately elms in front of them. And the theatres: the plays were brilliant,\nand the acting was incomparable. She often went with Madame Foyot, the\nmother of the girls she was educating, when she was trying on clothes.</p>",
  "page-378": "<p>\"Oh, what a misery to be poor!\" she cried. \"These beautiful things, it's\nonly in Paris they know how to dress, and not to be able to afford them!\nPoor Madame Foyot, she had no figure.

Of\ncourse it was impossible, and he might ring and ring, but she would never\nopen the door; and then while she was waiting for the tinkling of the\nbell, all nerves, suddenly he stood before her. She had forgotten to shut\nthe door when she came in.</p><p>\"C'etait une fatalite.\"</p><p>\"And what happened then?\" asked Philip.</p><p>\"That is the end of the story,\" she replied, with a ripple of laughter.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip was silent for a moment.

That sort of thing was all very well for married women, he had\nread enough French novels to know that in France it was indeed the rule,\nbut Miss Wilkinson was English and unmarried; her father was a clergyman.\nThen it struck him that the art-student probably was neither the first nor\nthe last of her lovers, and he gasped: he had never looked upon Miss\nWilkinson like that; it seemed incredible that anyone should make love to\nher.</p>",
  "page-385": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">In his ingenuousness he doubted her story as little as he doubted\nwhat he read in books, and he was angry that such wonderful things never\nhappened to him.

It was true that he had some power of invention, but he was not sure\nwhether he could persuade her that he was steeped in vice; women were full\nof intuition, he had read that, and she might easily discover that he was\nfibbing.

  "page-386": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">usual\nbashfulness he refused, but she insisted, and then every morning at a\nconvenient time after breakfast she gave him an hour's lesson. She had a\nnatural gift for teaching, and it was clear that she was an excellent\ngoverness. She had method and firmness. Though her French accent was so\nmuch part of her that it remained, all the mellifluousness of her manner\nleft her when she was engaged in teaching.

He looked at her more\nnarrowly. He liked her</p>",
  "page-387": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">much better in the evening than in the morning. In\nthe morning she was rather lined and the skin of her neck was just a\nlittle rough. He wished she would hide it, but the weather was very warm\njust then and she wore blouses which were cut low. She was very fond of\nwhite; in the morning it did not suit her. At night she often looked very\nattractive, she put on a gown which was almost a dinner dress, and she\nwore a chain of garnets round her neck; the lace about her bosom and at\nher elbows gave her a pleasant softness, and the scent she wore (at\nBlackstable no one used anything but Eau de Cologne, and that only on\nSundays or when suffering from a sick headache) was troubling and exotic.\nShe really looked very young then.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip was much exercised over her age. He added twenty and seventeen\ntogether, and could not bring them to a satisfactory total. He asked Aunt\nLouisa more than once why she thought Miss Wilkinson was</p>",
  "page-388": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thirty-seven: she\ndidn't look more than thirty, and everyone knew that foreigners aged more\nrapidly than English women; Miss Wilkinson had lived so long abroad that\nshe might almost be called a foreigner. He personally wouldn't have\nthought her more than twenty-six.</p><p>\"She's more than that,\" said Aunt Louisa.</p><p>Philip did not believe in the accuracy of the Careys' statements. All they\ndistinctly remembered was that Miss Wilkinson had not got her hair up the\nlast time they saw her in Lincolnshire. Well, she might have been twelve\nthen: it was so long ago and the Vicar was always so unreliable. They said\nit was twenty years ago, but people used round figures, and it was just as\nlikely to be eighteen years, or seventeen. Seventeen and twelve were only\ntwenty-nine, and hang it all, that wasn't old, was it? Cleopatra was\nforty-eight when Antony threw away the world for her sake.</p>",
  "page-389": "<p>It was a fine summer. Day after day was hot and cloudless; but the heat\nwas tempered by the neighbourhood of the sea, and there was a pleasant\nexhilaration in the air, so that one was excited and not oppressed by the\nAugust sunshine. There was a pond in the garden in which a fountain\nplayed; water lilies grew in it and gold fish sunned themselves on the\nsurface. Philip and Miss Wilkinson used to take rugs and cushions there\nafter dinner and lie on the lawn in the shade of a tall hedge of roses.\nThey talked and read all the afternoon. They smoked cigarettes, which the\nVicar did not allow in the house; he thought smoking a disgusting habit,\nand used frequently to say that it was disgraceful for anyone to grow a\nslave to a habit. He forgot that he was himself a slave to afternoon tea.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One day Miss Wilkinson gave Philip La Vie de Boheme. She had found it by\naccident when she was rummaging among the books in the Vicar's study.</p>",
  "page-390": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">It\nhad been bought in a lot with something Mr. Carey wanted and had remained\nundiscovered for ten years.</p><p>Philip began to read Murger's fascinating, ill-written, absurd\nmasterpiece, and fell at once under its spell. His soul danced with joy at\nthat picture of starvation which is so good-humoured, of squalor which is\nso picturesque, of sordid love which is so romantic, of bathos which is so\nmoving. Rodolphe and Mimi, Musette and Schaunard! They wander through the\ngray streets of the Latin Quarter, finding refuge now in one attic, now in\nanother, in their quaint costumes of Louis Philippe, with their tears and\ntheir smiles, happy-go-lucky and reckless. Who can resist them? It is only\nwhen you return to the book with a sounder judgment that you find how\ngross their pleasures were, how vulgar their minds; and you feel the utter\nworthlessness, as artists and as human beings, of that gay procession.\nPhilip was enraptured.</p>",
  "page-391": "<p>\"Don't you wish you were going to Paris instead of London?\" asked Miss\nWilkinson, smiling at his enthusiasm.</p><p>\"It's too late now even if I did,\" he answered.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">During the fortnight he had been back from Germany there had been much\ndiscussion between himself and his uncle about his future.

His entire fortune had consisted of only two thousand\npounds, and though it had been invested in mortgages at five per cent, he\nhad not been able to live on the interest. It was now a little reduced. It\nwould be absurd to spend two hundred a year, the least he could live on at\na university, for three years at Oxford which would lead him no nearer to\nearning his living. He was anxious to go straight to London. Mrs. Carey\nthought there were only</p>",
  "page-392": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">four professions for a gentleman, the Army, the\nNavy, the Law, and the Church. She had added medicine because her\nbrother-in-law practised it, but did not forget that in her young days no\none ever considered the doctor a gentleman. The first two were out of the\nquestion, and Philip was firm in his refusal to be ordained. Only the law\nremained. The local doctor had suggested that many gentlemen now went in\nfor engineering, but Mrs. Carey opposed the idea at once.</p><p>\"I shouldn't like Philip to go into trade,\" she said.</p><p>\"No, he must have a profession,\" answered the Vicar.</p><p>\"Why not make him a doctor like his father?\"</p><p>\"I should hate it,\" said Philip.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mrs. Carey was not sorry. The Bar seemed out of the question, since he was\nnot going to Oxford, for the Careys were under the impression that a\ndegree was still necessary for success in that calling; and finally it was\nsuggested that he should become articled to a solicitor.</p>",
  "page-393": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">They wrote to the\nfamily lawyer, Albert Nixon, who was co-executor with the Vicar of\nBlackstable for the late Henry Carey's estate, and asked him whether he\nwould take Philip. In a day or two the answer came back that he had not a\nvacancy, and was very much opposed to the whole scheme; the profession was\ngreatly overcrowded, and without capital or connections a man had small\nchance of becoming more than a managing clerk; he suggested, however, that\nPhilip should become a chartered accountant. Neither the Vicar nor his\nwife knew in the least what this was, and Philip had never heard of anyone\nbeing a chartered accountant; but another letter from the solicitor\nexplained that the growth of modern businesses and the increase of\ncompanies had led to the formation of many firms of accountants to examine\nthe books and put into the financial affairs of their clients an order\nwhich old-fashioned methods had lacked. Some years before a</p>",
  "page-394": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Royal Charter\nhad been obtained, and the profession was becoming every year more\nrespectable, lucrative, and important. The chartered accountants whom\nAlbert Nixon had employed for thirty years happened to have a vacancy for\nan articled pupil, and would take Philip for a fee of three hundred\npounds. Half of this would be returned during the five years the articles\nlasted in the form of salary. The prospect was not exciting, but Philip\nfelt that he must decide on something, and the thought of living in London\nover-balanced the slight shrinking he felt. The Vicar of Blackstable wrote\nto ask Mr. Nixon whether it was a profession suited to a gentleman; and\nMr. Nixon replied that, since the Charter, men were going into it who had\nbeen to public schools and a university; moreover, if Philip disliked the\nwork and after a year wished to leave, Herbert Carter, for that was the\naccountant's name, would return half the money paid for the articles.</p>",
  "page-395": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">This\nsettled it, and it was arranged that Philip should start work on the\nfifteenth of September.</p><p>\"I have a full month before me,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"And then you go to freedom and I to bondage,\" returned Miss Wilkinson.</p><p>Her holidays were to last six weeks, and she would be leaving Blackstable\nonly a day or two before Philip.</p><p>\"I wonder if we shall ever meet again,\" she said.</p><p>\"I don't know why not.\"</p><p>\"Oh, don't speak in that practical way.

He ought to make love to her. They had talked a\ngood deal of love. There was the art-student in the Rue Breda, and then\nthere was the</p>",
  "page-396": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">painter in whose family she had lived so long in Paris: he\nhad asked her to sit for him, and had started to make love to her so\nviolently that she was forced to invent excuses not to sit to him again.\nIt was clear enough that Miss Wilkinson was used to attentions of that\nsort. She looked very nice now in a large straw hat: it was hot that\nafternoon, the hottest day they had had, and beads of sweat stood in a\nline on her upper lip. He called to mind Fraulein Cacilie and Herr Sung.\nHe had never thought of Cacilie in an amorous way, she was exceedingly\nplain; but now, looking back, the affair seemed very romantic. He had a\nchance of romance too. Miss Wilkinson was practically French, and that\nadded zest to a possible adventure. When he thought of it at night in bed,\nor when he sat by himself in the garden reading a book, he was thrilled by\nit; but when he saw Miss Wilkinson it seemed less picturesque.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At all events, after what she had told him, she would</p>",
  "page-397": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">not be surprised if\nhe made love to her.

If he had been a Frenchman he would have\nseized her in his arms and told her passionately that he adored her; he\nwould have pressed his lips on her nuque. He did not know why Frenchmen\nalways kissed ladies on the nuque. He did not himself see anything so\nvery attractive in the nape of the neck. Of course it was much easier for\nFrenchmen to do these things; the language was such an aid; Philip could\nnever help feeling that to say passionate things in English sounded a\nlittle absurd. He wished now that he had never undertaken the siege of\nMiss Wilkinson's virtue; the first fortnight had been so jolly, and now he\nwas wretched; but he was determined not to give in, he would never respect\nhimself again if he did, and he made up his mind irrevocably that the\nnext night he would kiss her without fail.</p>",

She did not come down till\ntea-time, when she appeared in a becoming wrapper and a pale face; but she\nwas quite recovered by supper, and the meal was very cheerful.

There were two roses in her waistband. She sat\nin a garden chair by the side of the lawn, holding a red parasol over\nherself, and the light on her face was very becoming. Philip was fond of\ntennis. He served well and as he ran clumsily played close to the net:\nnotwithstanding his club-foot he was quick, and it was difficult to get a\nball past him.

The stars are all out.\"</p><p>He was in high spirits.</p><p>\"D'you know, Mrs. Carey has been scolding me on your account?\" said Miss\nWilkinson, when they were sauntering through the kitchen garden. \"She says\nI mustn't flirt with you.\"</p><p>\"Have you been flirting with me?

No one\nhad ever informed him before that his eyes were charming and that he had\na sensual mouth.

When he kissed her it was wonderful to feel the passion that\nseemed to thrill her soul. He kissed her a good deal, for he found it\neasier to do that than to say the things he instinctively felt she\nexpected of him. It still made him feel a fool to say he worshipped her.\nHe wished there were someone to whom he could boast a little, and he would\nwillingly have discussed minute points of his conduct. Sometimes she said\nthings that were enigmatic, and he was puzzled. He wished Hayward had been\nthere so that he could ask him what he thought she meant, and what he had\nbetter do next.

  "page-416": "<p>But on Sunday at tea-time she surprised Philip. \"I don't think I'll come\nto church this evening,\" she said suddenly. \"I've really got a dreadful\nheadache.\"</p><p>Mrs. Carey, much concerned, insisted on giving her some 'drops' which she\nwas herself in the habit of using.

He went into the hall and listened. There was not a sound.\nHe wondered if Miss Wilkinson really had a headache. Perhaps she had\nforgotten his suggestion. His heart beat painfully. He crept up the stairs\nas softly as he could, and he stopped with a start when they creaked. He\nstood outside Miss Wilkinson's room and listened; he put his hand on the\nknob of the door-handle.

His sleep had been restless; but when he\nstretched his legs and looked at the sunshine that slid through the\nVenetian blinds, making patterns on the floor, he sighed with\nsatisfaction. He was delighted with himself. He began to think of Miss\nWilkinson. She had asked him to call her Emily, but, he knew not why, he\ncould not; he always thought of her as Miss Wilkinson. Since she chid him\nfor so addressing her, he avoided using her name at all. During his\nchildhood he had often heard a sister of Aunt Louisa, the widow of a naval\nofficer, spoken of as</p>",
  "page-421": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Aunt Emily. It made him uncomfortable to call Miss\nWilkinson by that name, nor could he think of any that would have suited\nher better. She had begun as Miss Wilkinson, and it seemed inseparable\nfrom his impression of her. He frowned a little: somehow or other he saw\nher now at her worst; he could not forget his dismay when she turned round\nand he saw her in her camisole and the short petticoat; he remembered the\nslight roughness of her skin and the sharp, long lines on the side of the\nneck. His triumph was short-lived. He reckoned out her age again, and he\ndid not see how she could be less than forty. It made the affair\nridiculous. She was plain and old. His quick fancy showed her to him,\nwrinkled, haggard, made-up, in those frocks which were too showy for her\nposition and too young for her years. He shuddered; he felt suddenly that\nhe never wanted to see her again; he could not bear the thought of kissing\nher. He was horrified with himself. Was that</p>",
  "page-422": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">love?</p><p>He took as long as he could over dressing in order to put back the moment\nof seeing her, and when at last he went into the dining-room it was with\na sinking heart. Prayers were over, and they were sitting down at\nbreakfast.</p><p>\"Lazybones,\" Miss Wilkinson cried gaily.</p><p>He looked at her and gave a little gasp of relief. She was sitting with\nher back to the window. She was really quite nice. He wondered why he had\nthought such things about her. His self-satisfaction returned to him.</p><p>He was taken aback by the change in her. She told him in a voice thrilling\nwith emotion immediately after breakfast that she loved him; and when a\nlittle later they went into the drawing-room for his singing lesson and\nshe sat down on the music-stool she put up her face in the middle of a\nscale and said:</p><p>\"Embrasse-moi.\"</p>",
  "page-423": "<p>When he bent down she flung her arms round his neck. It was slightly\nuncomfortable, for she held him in such a position that he felt rather\nchoked.</p><p>\"Ah, je t'aime. Je t'aime. Je t'aime,\" she cried, with her extravagantly\nFrench accent.</p><p>Philip wished she would speak English.</p><p>\"I say, I don't know if it's struck you that the gardener's quite likely\nto pass the window any minute.\"</p><p>\"Ah, je m'en fiche du jardinier.

  "page-424": "<p>\"Would you like me to stay?\" he smiled.</p><p>\"Oh, you darling! But no, go. Go.

She was evidently frightfully\ngone on him. As he limped along the high street of Blackstable he looked\nwith a tinge of superciliousness at the people he passed. He knew a good\nmany to nod to, and as he gave them a smile of recognition he thought to\nhimself, if they only knew! He did want someone to know very badly. He\nthought he would write to Hayward, and in his mind composed the letter. He\nwould talk of the garden and the roses, and the little French governess,\nlike an exotic flower amongst them, scented and perverse: he would say she\nwas French, because—well, she had lived in France so</p>",
  "page-425": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">long that she almost\nwas, and besides it would be shabby to give the whole thing away too\nexactly, don't you know; and he would tell Hayward how he had seen her\nfirst in her pretty muslin dress and of the flower she had given him. He\nmade a delicate idyl of it: the sunshine and the sea gave it passion and\nmagic, and the stars added poetry, and the old vicarage garden was a fit\nand exquisite setting. There was something Meredithian about it: it was\nnot quite Lucy Feverel and not quite Clara Middleton; but it was\ninexpressibly charming. Philip's heart beat quickly. He was so delighted\nwith his fancies that he began thinking of them again as soon as he\ncrawled back, dripping and cold, into his bathing-machine. He thought of\nthe object of his affections. She had the most adorable little nose and\nlarge brown eyes—he would describe her to Hayward—and masses of soft\nbrown hair, the sort of hair it was delicious to bury your face in, and a\nskin which was like ivory and</p>",
  "page-426": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sunshine, and her cheek was like a red, red\nrose. How old was she? Eighteen perhaps, and he called her Musette. Her\nlaughter was like a rippling brook, and her voice was so soft, so low, it\nwas the sweetest music he had ever heard.</p><p>\"What ARE you thinking about?\"</p><p>Philip stopped suddenly. He was walking slowly home.</p><p>\"I've been waving at you for the last quarter of a mile. You ARE\nabsent-minded.\"</p><p>Miss Wilkinson was standing in front of him, laughing at his surprise.</p><p>\"I thought I'd come and meet you.\"</p><p>\"That's awfully nice of you,\" he said.</p><p>\"Did I startle you?\"</p><p>\"You did a bit,\" he admitted.</p><p>He wrote his letter to Hayward all the same. There were eight pages of it.</p>",
  "page-427": "<p>The fortnight that remained passed quickly, and though each evening, when\nthey went into the garden after supper, Miss Wilkinson remarked that one\nday more had gone, Philip was in too cheerful spirits to let the thought\ndepress him. One night Miss Wilkinson suggested that it would be\ndelightful if she could exchange her situation in Berlin for one in\nLondon. Then they could see one another constantly. Philip said it would\nbe very jolly, but the prospect aroused no enthusiasm in him; he was\nlooking forward to a wonderful life in London, and he preferred not to be\nhampered. He spoke a little too freely of all he meant to do, and allowed\nMiss Wilkinson to see that already he was longing to be off.</p><p>\"You wouldn't talk like that if you loved me,\" she cried.</p><p>He was taken aback and remained silent.</p><p>\"What a fool I've been,\" she muttered.</p>",
  "page-428": "<p>To his surprise he saw that she was crying. He had a tender heart, and\nhated to see anyone miserable.</p><p>\"Oh, I'm awfully sorry. What have I done? Don't cry.\"</p><p>\"Oh, Philip, don't leave me. You don't know what you mean to me. I have\nsuch a wretched life, and you've made me so happy.\"</p><p>He kissed her silently. There really was anguish in her tone, and he was\nfrightened. It had never occurred to him that she meant what she said\nquite, quite seriously.</p><p>\"I'm awfully sorry. You know I'm frightfully fond of you. I wish you would\ncome to London.\"</p><p>\"You know I can't. Places are almost impossible to get, and I hate English\nlife.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Almost unconscious that he was acting a part, moved by her distress, he\npressed her more and more. Her tears vaguely flattered him, and he kissed\nher with</p>",
  "page-429": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">real passion.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But a day or two later she made a real scene. There was a tennis-party at\nthe vicarage, and two girls came, daughters of a retired major in an\nIndian regiment who had lately settled in Blackstable. They were very\npretty, one was Philip's age and the other was a year or two younger.\nBeing used to the society of young men (they were full of stories of\nhill-stations in India, and at that time the stories of Rudyard Kipling\nwere in every hand) they began to chaff Philip gaily; and he, pleased with\nthe novelty—the young ladies at Blackstable treated the Vicar's nephew\nwith a certain seriousness—was gay and jolly. Some devil within him\nprompted him to start a violent flirtation with them both, and as he was\nthe only young man there, they were quite willing to meet him half-way. It\nhappened that they played tennis quite well and Philip was tired of\npat-ball with Miss Wilkinson (she had only begun to play when she came</p>",
  "page-430": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to\nBlackstable), so when he arranged the sets after tea he suggested that\nMiss Wilkinson should play against the curate's wife, with the curate as\nher partner; and he would play later with the new-comers. He sat down by\nthe elder Miss O'Connor and said to her in an undertone:</p><p>\"We'll get the duffers out of the way first, and then we'll have a jolly\nset afterwards.\"</p><p>Apparently Miss Wilkinson overheard him, for she threw down her racket,\nand, saying she had a headache, went away. It was plain to everyone that\nshe was offended. Philip was annoyed that she should make the fact public.\nThe set was arranged without her, but presently Mrs. Carey called him.</p><p>\"Philip, you've hurt Emily's feelings. She's gone to her room and she's\ncrying.\"</p><p>\"What about?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Oh, something about a duffer's set. Do go to her,</p>",
  "page-431": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and say you didn't mean\nto be unkind, there's a good boy.\"</p><p>\"All right.\"</p><p>He knocked at Miss Wilkinson's door, but receiving no answer went in. He\nfound her lying face downwards on her bed, weeping. He touched her on the\nshoulder.</p><p>\"I say, what on earth's the matter?\"</p><p>\"Leave me alone. I never want to speak to you again.\"</p><p>\"What have I done? I'm awfully sorry if I've hurt your feelings. I didn't\nmean to. I say, do get up.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I'm so unhappy. How could you be cruel to me? You know I hate that\nstupid game. I only play because I want to play with you.\"</p><p>She got up and walked towards the dressing-table, but after a quick look\nin the glass sank into a chair. She made her handkerchief into a ball and\ndabbed her eyes with it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I've given you the greatest thing a woman can give a</p>",
  "page-432": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">man—oh, what a fool\nI was—and you have no gratitude. You must be quite heartless. How could\nyou be so cruel as to torment me by flirting with those vulgar girls.\nWe've only got just over a week. Can't you even give me that?\"</p><p>Philip stood over her rather sulkily. He thought her behaviour childish.\nHe was vexed with her for having shown her ill-temper before strangers.</p><p>\"But you know I don't care twopence about either of the O'Connors. Why on\nearth should you think I do?\"</p><p>Miss Wilkinson put away her handkerchief. Her tears had made marks on her\npowdered face, and her hair was somewhat disarranged. Her white dress did\nnot suit her very well just then. She looked at Philip with hungry,\npassionate eyes.</p><p>\"Because you're twenty and so's she,\" she said hoarsely. \"And I'm old.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip reddened and looked away. The anguish of</p>",
  "page-433": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">her tone made him feel\nstrangely uneasy. He wished with all his heart that he had never had\nanything to do with Miss Wilkinson.</p><p>\"I don't want to make you unhappy,\" he said awkwardly. \"You'd better go\ndown and look after your friends. They'll wonder what has become of you.\"</p><p>\"All right.\"</p><p>He was glad to leave her.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The quarrel was quickly followed by a reconciliation, but the few days\nthat remained were sometimes irksome to Philip. He wanted to talk of\nnothing but the future, and the future invariably reduced Miss Wilkinson\nto tears. At first her weeping affected him, and feeling himself a beast\nhe redoubled his protestations of undying passion; but now it irritated\nhim: it would have been all very well if she had been a girl, but it was\nsilly of a grown-up woman to cry so much. She never ceased reminding him\nthat he was</p>",
  "page-434": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">under a debt of gratitude to her which he could never repay.\nHe was willing to acknowledge this since she made a point of it, but he\ndid not really know why he should be any more grateful to her than she to\nhim. He was expected to show his sense of obligation in ways which were\nrather a nuisance: he had been a good deal used to solitude, and it was a\nnecessity to him sometimes; but Miss Wilkinson looked upon it as an\nunkindness if he was not always at her beck and call. The Miss O'Connors\nasked them both to tea, and Philip would have liked to go, but Miss\nWilkinson said she only had five days more and wanted him entirely to\nherself. It was flattering, but a bore. Miss Wilkinson told him stories of\nthe exquisite delicacy of Frenchmen when they stood in the same relation\nto fair ladies as he to Miss Wilkinson. She praised their courtesy, their\npassion for self-sacrifice, their perfect tact. Miss Wilkinson seemed to\nwant a great deal.</p>",
  "page-435": "<p>Philip listened to her enumeration of the qualities which must be\npossessed by the perfect lover, and he could not help feeling a certain\nsatisfaction that she lived in Berlin.</p><p>\"You will write to me, won't you?

You must keep nothing from me.\"</p><p>\"I shall be awfully, busy\" he answered. \"I'll write as often as I can.\"</p><p>She flung her arms passionately round his neck. He was embarrassed\nsometimes by the demonstrations of her affection. He would have preferred\nher to be more passive.

Philip was\nsilent too, for he did not quite know what to say that would fit the\ncircumstance; and he was terribly afraid that, if he said something\nflippant, Miss Wilkinson would break down before his uncle and make a\nscene. They had said their last good-bye to one another in the garden the\nnight before, and Philip was relieved that there was now no opportunity\nfor them to be alone. He remained in the dining-room after breakfast in\ncase Miss Wilkinson should insist on kissing him on the stairs.

He said he hoped\nPhilip would like the work; there was a good deal of drudgery about it,\nbut when you got used to it, it was interesting; and one made money, that\nwas the chief thing, wasn't it?

He looked like a military\nman; his moustache was waxed, his gray hair was short and neat, he held\nhimself upright, he talked in a breezy way, he lived at Enfield. He was\nvery keen on games and the good of the country. He was an officer in the\nHertfordshire Yeomanry and chairman of the Conservative Association. When\nhe was told that a local magnate had said no one would take him for a City\nman, he felt that he had not lived in vain. He talked to Philip in a\npleasant, off-hand fashion.

He attended lectures for his first examination. Mr. Goodworthy\nrepeated to him that the work was dull at first, but he would grow used to\nit. Philip left the office at six and walked across the river to Waterloo.\nHis supper was waiting for him when he reached his lodgings and he spent\nthe evening reading. On Saturday afternoons he went to the National\nGallery. Hayward had recommended to him a guide which had been compiled\nout of Ruskin's works, and with this in hand he went industriously through\nroom after room: he read carefully what the critic had said about a\npicture and then in a determined fashion set himself to see the same\nthings in it. His Sundays were difficult to get through. He knew no one in\nLondon and spent them by himself. Mr. Nixon, the solicitor, asked him to\nspend a Sunday at Hampstead, and Philip passed a happy day</p>",
  "page-454": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">with a set of\nexuberant strangers; he ate and drank a great deal, took a walk on the\nheath, and came away with a general invitation to come again whenever he\nliked; but he was morbidly afraid of being in the way, so waited for a\nformal invitation. Naturally enough it never came, for with numbers of\nfriends of their own the Nixons did not think of the lonely, silent boy\nwhose claim upon their hospitality was so small. So on Sundays he got up\nlate and took a walk along the tow-path. At Barnes the river is muddy,\ndingy, and tidal; it has neither the graceful charm of the Thames above\nthe locks nor the romance of the crowded stream below London Bridge. In\nthe afternoon he walked about the common; and that is gray and dingy too;\nit is neither country nor town; the gorse is stunted; and all about is the\nlitter of civilisation. He went to a play every Saturday night and stood\ncheerfully for an hour or more at the gallery-door. It was not worth while\nto go</p>",
  "page-455": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">back to Barnes for the interval between the closing of the Museum\nand his meal in an A. B. C. shop, and the time hung heavily on his hands.\nHe strolled up Bond Street or through the Burlington Arcade, and when he\nwas tired went and sat down in the Park or in wet weather in the public\nlibrary in St. Martin's Lane. He looked at the people walking about and\nenvied them because they had friends; sometimes his envy turned to hatred\nbecause they were happy and he was miserable. He had never imagined that\nit was possible to be so lonely in a great city. Sometimes when he was\nstanding at the gallery-door the man next to him would attempt a\nconversation; but Philip had the country boy's suspicion of strangers and\nanswered in such a way as to prevent any further acquaintance. After the\nplay was over, obliged to keep to himself all he thought about it, he\nhurried across the bridge to Waterloo. When he got back to his rooms, in\nwhich for economy no fire had</p>",
  "page-456": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">been lit, his heart sank. It was horribly\ncheerless. He began to loathe his lodgings and the long solitary evenings\nhe spent in them. Sometimes he felt so lonely that he could not read, and\nthen he sat looking into the fire hour after hour in bitter wretchedness.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He had spent three months in London now, and except for that one Sunday at\nHampstead had never talked to anyone but his fellow-clerks. One evening\nWatson asked him to dinner at a restaurant and they went to a music-hall\ntogether; but he felt shy and uncomfortable. Watson talked all the time of\nthings he did not care about, and while he looked upon Watson as a\nPhilistine he could not help admiring him. He was angry because Watson\nobviously set no store on his culture, and with his way of taking himself\nat the estimate at which he saw others held him he began to despise the\nacquirements which till then had seemed to him not unimportant. He felt\nfor the first time the</p>",
  "page-457": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">humiliation of poverty. His uncle sent him fourteen\npounds a month and he had had to buy a good many clothes. His evening suit\ncost him five guineas. He had not dared tell Watson that it was bought in\nthe Strand. Watson said there was only one tailor in London.</p><p>\"I suppose you don't dance,\" said Watson, one day, with a glance at\nPhilip's club-foot.</p><p>\"No,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"Pity.

  "page-458": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">balcony and\nstood for a moment to get some fresh air; and Philip, imagining that they\nwere in love with one another, turned away and limped along the street\nwith a heavy hurt. He would never be able to stand in that man's place. He\nfelt that no woman could ever really look upon him without distaste for\nhis deformity.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That reminded him of Miss Wilkinson. He thought of her without\nsatisfaction. Before parting they had made an arrangement that she should\nwrite to Charing Cross Post Office till he was able to send her an\naddress, and when he went there he found three letters from her. She wrote\non blue paper with violet ink, and she wrote in French. Philip wondered\nwhy she could not write in English like a sensible woman, and her\npassionate expressions, because they reminded him of a French novel, left\nhim cold. She upbraided him for not having written, and when he answered\nhe excused himself by saying that he had been busy. He did not quite</p>",
  "page-459": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">know\nhow to start the letter. He could not bring himself to use dearest or\ndarling, and he hated to address her as Emily, so finally he began with\nthe word dear. It looked odd, standing by itself, and rather silly, but he\nmade it do. It was the first love letter he had ever written, and he was\nconscious of its tameness; he felt that he should say all sorts of\nvehement things, how he thought of her every minute of the day and how he\nlonged to kiss her beautiful hands and how he trembled at the thought of\nher red lips, but some inexplicable modesty prevented him; and instead he\ntold her of his new rooms and his office. The answer came by return of\npost, angry, heart-broken, reproachful: how could he be so cold? Did he\nnot know that she hung on his letters? She had given him all that a woman\ncould give, and this was her reward. Was he tired of her already? Then,\nbecause he did not reply for several days, Miss Wilkinson bombarded him\nwith letters. She could not</p>",
  "page-460": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">bear his unkindness, she waited for the post,\nand it never brought her his letter, she cried herself to sleep night\nafter night, she was looking so ill that everyone remarked on it: if he\ndid not love her why did he not say so? She added that she could not live\nwithout him, and the only thing was for her to commit suicide. She told\nhim he was cold and selfish and ungrateful. It was all in French, and\nPhilip knew that she wrote in that language to show off, but he was\nworried all the same. He did not want to make her unhappy. In a little\nwhile she wrote that she could not bear the separation any longer, she\nwould arrange to come over to London for Christmas. Philip wrote back that\nhe would like nothing better, only he had already an engagement to spend\nChristmas with friends in the country, and he did not see how he could\nbreak it. She answered that she did not wish to force herself on him, it\nwas quite evident that he did not wish to see her; she was deeply hurt,\nand she never</p>",
  "page-461": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thought he would repay with such cruelty all her kindness.\nHer letter was touching, and Philip thought he saw marks of her tears on\nthe paper; he wrote an impulsive reply saying that he was dreadfully sorry\nand imploring her to come; but it was with relief that he received her\nanswer in which she said that she found it would be impossible for her to\nget away. Presently when her letters came his heart sank: he delayed\nopening them, for he knew what they would contain, angry reproaches and\npathetic appeals; they would make him feel a perfect beast, and yet he did\nnot see with what he had to blame himself. He put off his answer from day\nto day, and then another letter would come, saying she was ill and lonely\nand miserable.</p><p>\"I wish to God I'd never had anything to do with her,\" he said.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He admired Watson because he arranged these things so easily. The young\nman had been engaged in an</p>",
  "page-462": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">intrigue with a girl who played in touring\ncompanies, and his account of the affair filled Philip with envious\namazement. But after a time Watson's young affections changed, and one day\nhe described the rupture to Philip.</p><p>\"I thought it was no good making any bones about it so I just told her I'd\nhad enough of her,\" he said.</p><p>\"Didn't she make an awful scene?\" asked Philip.</p><p>\"The usual thing, you know, but I told her it was no good trying on that\nsort of thing with me.\"</p><p>\"Did she cry?\"</p><p>\"She began to, but I can't stand women when they cry, so I said she'd\nbetter hook it.\"</p><p>Philip's sense of humour was growing keener with advancing years.</p><p>\"And did she hook it?\" he asked smiling.</p><p>\"Well, there wasn't anything else for her to do, was there?\"</p>",
  "page-463": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Meanwhile the Christmas holidays approached. Mrs. Carey had been ill all\nthrough November, and the doctor suggested that she and the Vicar should\ngo to Cornwall for a couple of weeks round Christmas so that she should\nget back her strength. The result was that Philip had nowhere to go, and\nhe spent Christmas Day in his lodgings. Under Hayward's influence he had\npersuaded himself that the festivities that attend this season were vulgar\nand barbaric, and he made up his mind that he would take no notice of the\nday; but when it came, the jollity of all around affected him strangely.\nHis landlady and her husband were spending the day with a married\ndaughter, and to save trouble Philip announced that he would take his\nmeals out. He went up to London towards mid-day and ate a slice of turkey\nand some Christmas pudding by himself at Gatti's, and since he had nothing\nto do afterwards went to Westminster Abbey for the afternoon service.</p>",
  "page-464": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">The\nstreets were almost empty, and the people who went along had a preoccupied\nlook; they did not saunter but walked with some definite goal in view, and\nhardly anyone was alone. To Philip they all seemed happy. He felt himself\nmore solitary than he had ever done in his life. His intention had been to\nkill the day somehow in the streets and then dine at a restaurant, but he\ncould not face again the sight of cheerful people, talking, laughing, and\nmaking merry; so he went back to Waterloo, and on his way through the\nWestminster Bridge Road bought some ham and a couple of mince pies and\nwent back to Barnes. He ate his food in his lonely little room and spent\nthe evening with a book. His depression was almost intolerable.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When he was back at the office it made him very sore to listen to Watson's\naccount of the short holiday.

  "page-466": "<h3>Xxxviii.</h3><p class=\" stretch-last-line start-chapter\">At the end of the year there was a great deal to do. Philip went to\nvarious places with a clerk named Thompson and spent the day monotonously\ncalling out items of expenditure, which the other checked; and sometimes\nhe was given long pages of figures to add up. He had never had a head for\nfigures, and he could only do this slowly. Thompson grew irritated at his\nmistakes. His fellow-clerk was a long, lean man of forty, sallow, with\nblack hair and a ragged moustache; he had hollow cheeks and deep lines on\neach side of his nose. He took a dislike to Philip because he was an\narticled clerk.</p>",
  "page-467": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Because he could put down three hundred guineas and keep\nhimself for five years Philip had the chance of a career; while he, with\nhis experience and ability, had no possibility of ever being more than a\nclerk at thirty-five shillings a week. He was a cross-grained man,\noppressed by a large family, and he resented the superciliousness which he\nfancied he saw in Philip. He sneered at Philip because he was better\neducated than himself, and he mocked at Philip's pronunciation; he could\nnot forgive him because he spoke without a cockney accent, and when he\ntalked to him sarcastically exaggerated his aitches. At first his manner\nwas merely gruff and repellent, but as he discovered that Philip had no\ngift for accountancy he took pleasure in humiliating him; his attacks were\ngross and silly, but they wounded Philip, and in self-defence he assumed\nan attitude of superiority which he did not feel.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Had a bath this morning?\" Thompson said when</p>",

At\nfirst the work had been tolerable from its novelty, but now it grew\nirksome; and when he discovered that he had no aptitude for it, he began\nto hate it. Often, when he should have been doing something that was given\nhim, he wasted his time drawing little pictures on the office note-paper.\nHe made sketches of Watson in every conceivable attitude, and Watson was\nimpressed by his talent.

The fact that the\nother clerks disliked them equally, because they belonged to a class a\nlittle higher than their own, was a bond of union. When Philip thought\nthat he must spend over four years more with that dreary set of fellows\nhis heart sank. He had expected wonderful things from London and it had\ngiven him nothing. He hated it now. He did not know a soul, and he had no\nidea how he was to get to know anyone. He was tired of going everywhere by\nhimself. He began to feel that he could not stand much more of such a\nlife. He would lie in bed at night and think of the joy of never seeing\nagain that dingy office or any of the men in it, and of getting away from\nthose drab lodgings.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A great disappointment befell him in the spring.

He was quite excited at the thought of talking his fill\nwith someone, and he was wretched when Hayward wrote to say that the\nspring was lovelier than ever he had known it in Italy, and he could not\nbear to tear himself away. He went on to ask why Philip did not come. What\nwas the use of squandering the days of his youth in an office when the\nworld was beautiful? The letter proceeded.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I wonder you can bear it. I think of Fleet Street and Lincoln's Inn now\nwith a shudder of disgust.

They all\nthought he had talent; at Heidelberg they had admired his water colours,\nMiss Wilkinson had told him over and over again that they were chasing;\neven strangers like the Watsons had been struck by his sketches.

She told him that he could manage\neasily on eighty pounds a year, and she enthusiastically approved of his\nproject. She told him he was too good to be wasted in an office. Who would\nbe a clerk when he might be a great artist, she asked dramatically, and\nshe besought Philip to believe in himself: that was the great thing. But\nPhilip had a cautious nature. It was all very well for Hayward to talk of\ntaking risks, he had three hundred a year in gilt-edged securities;\nPhilip's entire fortune amounted to no more than eighteen-hundred pounds.\nHe hesitated.</p>",

They were met at the door of the hotel by the manager, a\nstout, pleasant man, who spoke tolerable English; Mr. Goodworthy was an\nold friend and he greeted them effusively; they dined in his private room\nwith his wife, and to Philip it seemed that he had never eaten anything so\ndelicious as the beefsteak aux pommes, nor drunk such nectar as the vin\nordinaire, which were set before them.</p>",

He was to have his holiday during the last fortnight in\nAugust, and when he went away he would tell Herbert Carter that he had no\nintention of returning.

  "page-500": "<p>\"Oh, there's nothing like that here,\" she said. \"You see, about half our\nstudents are ladies, and they set a tone to the place.\"</p><p>The studio was large and bare, with gray walls, on which were pinned the\nstudies that had received prizes. A model was sitting in a chair with a\nloose wrap thrown over her, and about a dozen men and women were standing\nabout, some talking and others still working on their sketch. It was the\nfirst rest of the model.</p><p>\"You'd better not try anything too difficult at first,\" said Mrs. Otter.\n\"Put your easel here.

It was hot in the studio, and drops of sweat stood on\nher forehead. She was a girl of twenty-six, with a great deal of dull gold\nhair; it was handsome hair, but it was carelessly done, dragged back from\nher forehead and tied in a hurried knot. She had a large face, with broad,\nflat features and small eyes; her skin was pasty, with a singular\nunhealthiness of tone, and there was no</p>",

Philip\nlistened with all his ears, and though he felt a little out of it, his\nheart leaped with exultation. The time flew. When Clutton got up he said:</p>",

It was not at all like\nthe Paris he had seen in the spring during his visit to do the accounts of\nthe Hotel St. Georges—he thought already of that part of his life with a\nshudder—but reminded him of what he thought a provincial town must be.\nThere was an easy-going air about it, and a sunny spaciousness which\ninvited the mind to day-dreaming. The trimness of the trees, the vivid\nwhiteness of the houses, the breadth, were very agreeable; and he felt\nhimself already thoroughly at home. He sauntered along, staring at</p>",
  "page-513": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\npeople; there seemed an elegance about the most ordinary, workmen with\ntheir broad red sashes and their wide trousers, little soldiers in dingy,\ncharming uniforms. He came presently to the Avenue de l'Observatoire, and\nhe gave a sigh of pleasure at the magnificent, yet so graceful, vista. He\ncame to the gardens of the Luxembourg: children were playing, nurses with\nlong ribbons walked slowly two by two, busy men passed through with\nsatchels under their arms, youths strangely dressed. The scene was formal\nand dainty; nature was arranged and ordered, but so exquisitely, that\nnature unordered and unarranged seemed barbaric. Philip was enchanted. It\nexcited him to stand on that spot of which he had read so much; it was\nclassic ground to him; and he felt the awe and the delight which some old\ndon might feel when for the first time he looked on the smiling plain of\nSparta.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As he wandered he chanced to see Miss Price sitting</p>",
  "page-514": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">by herself on a bench.\nHe hesitated, for he did not at that moment want to see anyone, and her\nuncouth way seemed out of place amid the happiness he felt around him; but\nhe had divined her sensitiveness to affront, and since she had seen him\nthought it would be polite to speak to her.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" she said, as he came up.</p><p>\"Enjoying myself.

  "page-515": "<p>\"No, I don't think he did,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"He's no good, you know. He thinks he's a genius, but he isn't. He's too\nlazy, for one thing. Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains. The\nonly thing is to peg away. If one only makes up one's mind badly enough to\ndo a thing one can't help doing it.\"</p><p>She spoke with a passionate strenuousness which was rather striking. She\nwore a sailor hat of black straw, a white blouse which was not quite\nclean, and a brown skirt. She had no gloves on, and her hands wanted\nwashing. She was so unattractive that Philip wished he had not begun to\ntalk to her. He could not make out whether she wanted him to stay or go.</p><p>\"I'll do anything I can for you,\" she said all at once, without reference\nto anything that had gone before. \"I know how hard it is.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Thank you very much,\" said Philip, then in a moment: \"Won't you come and\nhave tea with me</p>",
  "page-516": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">somewhere?\"</p><p>She looked at him quickly and flushed. When she reddened her pasty skin\nacquired a curiously mottled look, like strawberries and cream that had\ngone bad.</p><p>\"No, thanks. What d'you think I want tea for? I've only just had lunch.\"</p><p>\"I thought it would pass the time,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"If you find it long you needn't bother about me, you know.

But it doesn't\nmatter to them, they've all got money.\"</p><p>Philip liked the daring picturesqueness of the Americans' costume; he\nthought it showed the romantic spirit. Miss Price asked him the time.</p><p>\"I must be getting along to the studio,\" she said. \"Are you going to the\nsketch classes?\"</p><p>Philip did not know anything about them, and she told him that from five\nto six every evening a model sat, from whom anyone who liked could go and\ndraw at the cost of fifty centimes.

It\nwas very warm, and the air quickly grew fetid. It was an old man who sat\nthis time, with a vast gray beard, and Philip tried to put into practice\nthe little he had learned in the morning; but he made a poor job of it; he\nrealised that he could not draw nearly as well as he thought. He glanced\nenviously at one or two sketches of men who sat near</p>",
  "page-519": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">him, and wondered\nwhether he would ever be able to use the charcoal with that mastery. The\nhour passed quickly.

Absinthe! of course it was\nindicated, and so, sauntering towards the station, he seated himself\noutside a cafe and ordered it. He drank with nausea and satisfaction. He\nfound the taste disgusting, but the moral effect magnificent; he felt\nevery inch an art-student; and since he drank on an empty stomach his\nspirits presently grew very high. He watched the crowds, and felt all men\nwere his brothers. He was happy. When he reached Gravier's the table at\nwhich Clutton sat was full, but as soon as he saw Philip limping along he\ncalled out to him. They made room. The dinner was frugal, a plate of soup,\na dish of meat, fruit, cheese, and half a bottle of wine; but Philip paid\nno attention to what he ate. He took note of the men at the table.\nFlanagan was there again: he was an American, a short, snub-nosed youth\nwith a jolly face and a laughing mouth. He wore a Norfolk jacket of</p>",

As\nPhilip sat down he fixed them on him and remarked suddenly:</p>",
  "page-522": "<p>\"Raphael was only tolerable when he painted other people's pictures.

  "page-523": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dressed like those fine\nfellows whom Philip had seen that afternoon in the Luxembourg. He had a\nhandsome face, thin, ascetic, with dark eyes; he wore his fantastic garb\nwith the dashing air of a buccaneer. He had a vast quantity of dark hair\nwhich fell constantly over his eyes, and his most frequent gesture was to\nthrow back his head dramatically to get some long wisp out of the way.

Nor did he conceal his contempt for the\nstudents whose work he examined. By them he was hated and feared; the\nwomen by his brutal sarcasm he reduced often to tears, which again aroused\nhis ridicule; and he remained at the studio, notwithstanding the protests\nof those who suffered too bitterly from his attacks, because there could\nbe no doubt that he was</p>",
  "page-547": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">one of the best masters in Paris.

He was already in\nthe studio when Philip arrived. He went round from easel to easel, with\nMrs. Otter, the massiere, by his side to interpret his remarks for the\nbenefit of those who could not understand French. Fanny Price, sitting\nnext to Philip, was working feverishly.

Suddenly she turned to Philip with\nan anxious look, which she tried to hide by a sullen frown.</p><p>\"D'you think it's good?\" she asked, nodding at her drawing.</p>",
  "page-548": "<p>Philip got up and looked at it.

  "page-550": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">by\nthis time Philip was nervous too but Mrs. Otter had promised to make\nthings easy for him.

  "page-551": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">felt with\nsatisfaction that he grasped what he said and the reasons of it; most of\nthem listened to him, but it was clear they never understood.

  "page-555": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">waited behind after the\nothers to say to her something consolatory. He could think of nothing but:</p><p>\"I say, I'm awfully sorry.

The pretty colour of the first, the affected\ndrawing of the second, had entirely satisfied his aesthetic sensibilities.\nTheir vague idealism, the suspicion of a philosophical idea which underlay\nthe titles they gave their pictures, accorded very well with the functions\nof art as from his diligent perusal of Ruskin he understood it; but here\nwas something quite different: here was no moral appeal; and the\ncontemplation of these works could help no one to lead a purer and a\nhigher life. He was puzzled.</p><p>At last he said: \"You know, I'm simply dead. I don't think I can absorb\nanything more profitably. Let's go and sit down on one of the benches.\"</p>",

It was said that in the little studio in the Rue Campagne\nPremiere, which served him for work-room and bed-room, he had wonderful\npictures which would make his reputation if only he could be induced to\nexhibit them. He could not afford a model but painted still life, and\nLawson constantly talked of a plate of apples which he declared was a\nmasterpiece. He was fastidious, and, aiming at something he did not quite\nfully grasp, was constantly dissatisfied with his work as a whole: perhaps\na part would please him, the forearm or the leg and foot of a figure, a\nglass or a cup in a still-life; and he would cut this out and keep it,\ndestroying the rest of the canvas; so that when people invited themselves\nto see his work he could truthfully answer that he had not a single\npicture</p>",

They went to\nplays together and sometimes to the gallery of the Opera Comique. There\nwas the Odeon quite near them, and Philip soon shared his friend's passion\nfor the tragedians of Louis XIV and the sonorous Alexandrine.

He looked at the\nunopened letter with dismay. He was afraid that Miss Wilkinson had\nsuffered a good deal, and it made him feel a brute; but she had probably\ngot over the suffering by now, at all events the worst of it. It suggested\nitself to him that women were often very emphatic in their expressions.\nThese did not mean so much as when men used them. He had quite made up</p>",
  "page-577": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his\nmind that nothing would induce him ever to see her again. He had not\nwritten for so long that it seemed hardly worth while to write now.

Sisley\nand Monet had painted the canal with its poplars, and they felt a desire\nto try their hands at what was so typical of France; but they were\nfrightened of its formal beauty, and set themselves deliberately to avoid\nit. Miss Chalice, who had a clever dexterity which impressed Lawson\nnotwithstanding his contempt for feminine art, started a picture in which\nshe tried to circumvent the commonplace by leaving out the tops of the\ntrees; and Lawson had the brilliant idea of putting in his foreground a\nlarge blue advertisement of chocolat Menier in order to emphasise his\nabhorrence of the chocolate box.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip began now to paint in oils.

Through July they had one fine day after\nanother; it was very hot; and the heat, searing Philip's heart, filled him\nwith languor; he could not work; his mind was eager with a thousand\nthoughts. Often he spent the mornings by the side of the canal in the\nshade of the poplars, reading a few lines and then dreaming for half an\nhour. Sometimes he hired a rickety bicycle and rode along the dusty road\nthat led to the forest, and then lay down in a clearing. His head was full\nof</p>",

She told Philip lewd stories.</p><p>\"You must go to Seville,\" she said—she spoke a little broken English.\n\"The most beautiful women in the world.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She leered and nodded her head.

They\nlistened to the murmur of the river. The church clock struck one and two\nand sometimes three before they could drag themselves to bed. Suddenly\nPhilip became aware that Ruth Chalice and Lawson were lovers. He divined\nit in the way the girl looked at the young painter, and in his air of\npossession; and as Philip sat with them he felt a kind of effluence\nsurrounding them, as though the air were heavy with something strange.

It would have been very charming only her\nfeet were rather large and she had on both a large corn on the third toe.\nPhilip felt it made her proceeding a little ridiculous. But now he looked\nupon her quite differently; there was something softly feminine in her\nlarge eyes and her olive skin; he felt himself a fool not to have seen\nthat she was attractive. He thought he detected in her a touch of contempt\nfor him, because he had not had the sense to see that she was there, in\nhis way, and in Lawson a suspicion of superiority. He was envious of\nLawson, and he was jealous, not of the individual concerned, but of his\nlove. He wished that he was standing in his shoes and feeling with his\nheart. He</p>",

He wanted a passion to seize him, he wanted to be swept off his feet\nand borne powerless in a mighty rush he cared not whither.

He shuddered.\nHe threw himself on the grass, stretching his limbs like a young animal\nfreshly awaked from sleep; and the rippling water, the poplars gently\ntremulous in the faint breeze, the blue sky, were almost more than he\ncould bear. He was in love with love. In his fancy he felt the kiss of\nwarm lips on his, and around his neck the touch of soft hands. He imagined\nhimself in the arms of Ruth Chalice, he thought of her dark eyes and the\nwonderful texture of her skin; he was mad to have let such a wonderful\nadventure slip through his fingers.

He\nhoped to have something done of sufficient importance to send to the\nfollowing year's Salon.

A natural indolence, joined with a\npassion for picturesque attitude, made her an excellent sitter; and she\nhad enough technical knowledge to offer useful criticisms. Since her\npassion for art was chiefly a passion to live the life of artists, she was\nquite content to neglect her own work.

  "page-642": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Lawson\nand Miss Chalice freely gave him. At last Lawson finished and invited\nClutton in to criticise. Clutton had only just come back to Paris. From\nProvence he had drifted down to Spain, eager to see Velasquez at Madrid,\nand thence he had gone to Toledo. He stayed there three months, and he was\nreturned with a name new to the young men: he had wonderful things to say\nof a painter called El Greco, who it appeared could only be studied in\nToledo.</p><p>\"Oh yes, I know about him,\" said Lawson, \"he's the old master whose\ndistinction it is that he painted as badly as the moderns.\"</p><p>Clutton, more taciturn than ever, did not answer, but he looked at Lawson\nwith a sardonic air.</p><p>\"Are you going to show us the stuff you've brought back from Spain?\" asked\nPhilip.</p><p>\"I didn't paint in Spain, I was too busy.\"</p><p>\"What did you do then?\"</p>",

The Impressionists had been\noccupied with other problems, they had painted man admirably, but they had\ntroubled themselves as little as the English portrait painters of</p>",
  "page-646": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\neighteenth century with the intention of his soul.</p><p>\"But when you try to get that you become literary,\" said Lawson,\ninterrupting. \"Let me paint the man like Manet, and the intention of his\nsoul can go to the devil.\"</p><p>\"That would be all very well if you could beat Manet at his own game, but\nyou can't get anywhere near him.

They're quite neat and decent, aren't\nthey?\"</p><p>It chanced that Potter, one of the Americans who worked at Amitrano's, was\ngoing to Italy for a couple of months, and offered his studio to Philip.\nPhilip was pleased. He was growing a little impatient of Lawson's\nperemptory advice and wanted to be by himself. At the end of the week he\nwent up to the model and on the pretence that his drawing was not finished\nasked whether he would come and sit to him one day.</p><p>\"I'm not a model,\" the Spaniard answered. \"I have other things to do next\nweek.\"</p>",

How could you tell whether there was anything in it or whether you\nwere wasting your time? It was clear that the will to achieve could not\nhelp you and confidence in yourself meant nothing. Philip thought of Fanny\nPrice; she had a vehement belief in her talent; her strength of will was\nextraordinary.</p>",
  "page-656": "<p>\"If I thought I wasn't going to be really good, I'd rather give up\npainting,\" said Philip. \"I don't see any use in being a second-rate\npainter.\"</p><p>Then one morning when he was going out, the concierge called out to him\nthat there was a letter.

I couldn't put up with it any more.\nPlease come yourself. I can't bear the thought that anyone else should\ntouch me. I want you to have everything.</p><p>F.

The wretched woman was hanging with a\nrope round her neck, which she had tied to a hook in the ceiling fixed by\nsome previous tenant to hold up the curtains of the bed. She had moved her\nown little bed out of the way and had stood on a chair, which had been\nkicked away. It was lying on its side on the floor.

  "page-659": "<h3>Xlix.</h3><p class=\" stretch-last-line start-chapter\">The story which Philip made out in one way and another was terrible. One\nof the grievances of the women-students was that Fanny Price would never\nshare their gay meals in restaurants, and the reason was obvious: she had\nbeen oppressed by dire poverty. He remembered the luncheon they had eaten\ntogether when first he came to Paris and the ghoulish appetite which had\ndisgusted him: he realised now that she ate in that manner because she was\nravenous. The concierge told him what her food had consisted of. A\nbottle of milk was left for her every day and she brought in her</p>",
  "page-660": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">own loaf\nof bread; she ate half the loaf and drank half the milk at mid-day when\nshe came back from the school, and consumed the rest in the evening. It\nwas the same day after day. Philip thought with anguish of what she must\nhave endured. She had never given anyone to understand that she was poorer\nthan the rest, but it was clear that her money had been coming to an end,\nand at last she could not afford to come any more to the studio. The\nlittle room was almost bare of furniture, and there were no other clothes\nthan the shabby brown dress she had always worn. Philip searched among her\nthings for the address of some friend with whom he could communicate. He\nfound a piece of paper on which his own name was written a score of times.\nIt gave him a peculiar shock. He supposed it was true that she had loved\nhim; he thought of the emaciated body, in the brown dress, hanging from\nthe nail in the ceiling; and he shuddered. But if she had cared for him\nwhy did</p>",
  "page-661": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">she not let him help her? He would so gladly have done all he\ncould. He felt remorseful because he had refused to see that she looked\nupon him with any particular feeling, and now these words in her letter\nwere infinitely pathetic: I can't bear the thought that anyone else should\ntouch me. She had died of starvation.</p><p>Philip found at length a letter signed: your loving brother, Albert. It\nwas two or three weeks old, dated from some road in Surbiton, and refused\na loan of five pounds. The writer had his wife and family to think of, he\ndidn't feel justified in lending money, and his advice was that Fanny\nshould come back to London and try to get a situation. Philip telegraphed\nto Albert Price, and in a little while an answer came:</p><p>\"Deeply distressed. Very awkward to leave my business. Is presence\nessential. Price.\"</p><p>Philip wired a succinct affirmative, and next morning a stranger presented\nhimself at the studio.</p>",
  "page-662": "<p>\"My name's Price,\" he said, when Philip opened the door.</p><p>He was a commonish man in black with a band round his bowler hat; he had\nsomething of Fanny's clumsy look; he wore a stubbly moustache, and had a\ncockney accent. Philip asked him to come in. He cast sidelong glances\nround the studio while Philip gave him details of the accident and told\nhim what he had done.</p><p>\"I needn't see her, need I?\" asked Albert Price. \"My nerves aren't very\nstrong, and it takes very little to upset me.\"</p><p>He began to talk freely. He was a rubber-merchant, and he had a wife and\nthree children. Fanny was a governess, and he couldn't make out why she\nhadn't stuck to that instead of coming to Paris.</p><p>\"Me and Mrs. Price told her Paris was no place for a girl.

She might 'ave done it so as not to disgrace\nherself.\"</p><p>Philip felt himself reddening and cursed his weakness.

They went to the\ntiny room in which poor Fanny had lived. Albert Price looked at the\npictures and the furniture.</p><p>\"I don't pretend to know much about art,\" he said. \"I suppose these\npictures would fetch something, would they?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"The furniture's not worth ten shillings.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Albert Price knew no French and Philip had to do everything.

Philip, looking across the\ncemetery crowded on all sides with monuments, some poor and simple, others\nvulgar, pretentious, and ugly, shuddered. It was horribly sordid. When\nthey came out Albert Price asked Philip to lunch with him. Philip loathed\nhim now and he was tired; he had not been sleeping well, for he dreamed\nconstantly of Fanny Price</p>",

He represented it to\nhimself as deplorable, but he was anxious for details of the orgies which\nhis fancy suggested to him. With sly winks and discreet sniggering he\nconveyed that he knew very well that there was a great deal more than\nPhilip confessed. He was a</p>",
  "page-667": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">man of the world, and he knew a thing or two.\nHe asked Philip whether he had ever been to any of those places in\nMontmartre which are celebrated from Temple Bar to the Royal Exchange. He\nwould like to say he had been to the Moulin Rouge. The luncheon was very\ngood and the wine excellent. Albert Price expanded as the processes of\ndigestion went satisfactorily forwards.</p><p>\"Let's 'ave a little brandy,\" he said when the coffee was brought, \"and\nblow the expense.\"</p><p>He rubbed his hands.</p><p>\"You know, I've got 'alf a mind to stay over tonight and go back tomorrow.\nWhat d'you say to spending the evening together?\"</p><p>\"If you mean you want me to take you round Montmartre tonight, I'll see\nyou damned,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"I suppose it wouldn't be quite the thing.\"</p><p>The answer was made so seriously that Philip was tickled.</p>",
  "page-668": "<p>\"Besides it would be rotten for your nerves,\" he said gravely.</p><p>Albert Price concluded that he had better go back to London by the four\no'clock train, and presently he took leave of Philip.</p><p>\"Well, good-bye, old man,\" he said. \"I tell you what, I'll try and come\nover to Paris again one of these days and I'll look you up.

It was icy underground in the cemetery at Montparnasse among all\nthose white tombstones. Philip felt lonely in</p>",
  "page-669": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the world and strangely\nhomesick. He wanted company. At that hour Cronshaw would be working, and\nClutton never welcomed visitors; Lawson was painting another portrait of\nRuth Chalice and would not care to be disturbed. He made up his mind to go\nand see Flanagan. He found him painting, but delighted to throw up his\nwork and talk. The studio was comfortable, for the American had more money\nthan most of them, and warm; Flanagan set about making tea.

He exaggerated the Americanisms\nwhich he knew always made the Englishmen laugh and poured out a breathless\nstream of conversation, whimsical, high-spirited, and jolly. In due course\nthey went out to dinner and afterwards to the Gaite Montparnasse, which\nwas Flanagan's favourite place of amusement. By the end of the evening he\nwas in his most extravagant humour. He had drunk a good deal, but any\ninebriety from which he suffered was due much more to his own vivacity\nthan to alcohol. He proposed that they should go to the Bal Bullier, and\nPhilip, feeling too tired to go to bed, willingly enough</p>",
  "page-672": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">consented. They\nsat down at a table on the platform at the side, raised a little from the\nlevel of the floor so that they could watch the dancing, and drank a bock.\nPresently Flanagan saw a friend and with a wild shout leaped over the\nbarrier on to the space where they were dancing. Philip watched the\npeople. Bullier was not the resort of fashion. It was Thursday night and\nthe place was crowded. There were a number of students of the various\nfaculties, but most of the men were clerks or assistants in shops; they\nwore their everyday clothes, ready-made tweeds or queer tail-coats, and\ntheir hats, for they had brought them in with them, and when they danced\nthere was no place to put them but their heads. Some of the women looked\nlike servant-girls, and some were painted hussies, but for the most part\nthey were shop-girls.

Philip leaned\nover the rail, staring down, and he ceased to hear the music. They danced\nfuriously. They danced round the room, slowly, talking very little, with\nall their attention given to the dance. The room was hot, and their faces\nshone with sweat. It seemed to Philip that they had thrown off the guard\nwhich people wear on their expression, the homage to convention, and he\nsaw them now as they really were. In that moment of abandon they were\nstrangely animal: some were foxy and some were wolf-like; and others had\nthe long, foolish face of sheep.

And I'll tell you another reason why criticism is meaningless: a\ngreat painter forces the world to see nature as he sees it; but in the\nnext generation another painter sees the world in another way, and then\nthe public judges him not by himself but by his predecessor. So the\nBarbizon people taught our fathers to look at trees in a certain</p>",

  "page-686": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">concealed a\nstrange weakness. Clutton's refusal to show his work might be sheer\nvanity: he could not bear the thought of anyone's criticism, and he would\nnot expose himself to the chance of a refusal from the Salon; he wanted to\nbe received as a master and would not risk comparisons with other work\nwhich might force him to diminish his own opinion of himself. During the\neighteen months Philip had known him Clutton had grown more harsh and\nbitter; though he would not come out into the open and compete with his\nfellows, he was indignant with the facile success of those who did.

Of late Philip had been captivated by an idea that since one\nhad only one life it was important to make a success of it, but he did not\ncount success by the acquiring of money or the achieving of fame; he did\nnot quite know yet what he meant by it, perhaps variety of experience and\nthe making the most of his abilities. It was plain anyway that the life\nwhich Clutton seemed destined to was failure. Its only justification would\nbe the painting of imperishable masterpieces. He recollected Cronshaw's\nwhimsical metaphor of the Persian carpet; he had</p>",
  "page-688": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thought of it often; but\nCronshaw with his faun-like humour had refused to make his meaning clear:\nhe repeated that it had none unless one discovered it for oneself. It was\nthis desire to make a success of life which was at the bottom of Philip's\nuncertainty about continuing his artistic career. But Clutton began to\ntalk again.</p><p>\"D'you remember my telling you about that chap I met in Brittany? I saw\nhim the other day here. He's just off to Tahiti. He was broke to the\nworld. He was a brasseur d'affaires, a stockbroker I suppose you call it\nin English; and he had a wife and family, and he was earning a large\nincome. He chucked it all to become a painter. He just went off and\nsettled down in Brittany and began to paint. He hadn't got any money and\ndid the next best thing to starving.\"</p><p>\"And what about his wife and family?\" asked Philip.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Oh, he dropped them. He left them to starve on</p>",
  "page-689": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">their own account.\"</p><p>\"It sounds a pretty low-down thing to do.\"</p><p>\"Oh, my dear fellow, if you want to be a gentleman you must give up being\nan artist. They've got nothing to do with one another. You hear of men\npainting pot-boilers to keep an aged mother—well, it shows they're\nexcellent sons, but it's no excuse for bad work. They're only tradesmen.\nAn artist would let his mother go to the workhouse. There's a writer I\nknow over here who told me that his wife died in childbirth. He was in\nlove with her and he was mad with grief, but as he sat at the bedside\nwatching her die he found himself making mental notes of how she looked\nand what she said and the things he was feeling. Gentlemanly, wasn't it?\"</p><p>\"But is your friend a good painter?\" asked Philip.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"No, not yet, he paints just like Pissarro. He hasn't found himself, but\nhe's got a sense of colour and a sense of decoration. But that isn't the\nquestion. It's the</p>",
  "page-690": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">feeling, and that he's got. He's behaved like a perfect\ncad to his wife and children, he's always behaving like a perfect cad; the\nway he treats the people who've helped him—and sometimes he's been saved\nfrom starvation merely by the kindness of his friends—is simply beastly.\nHe just happens to be a great artist.\"</p><p>Philip pondered over the man who was willing to sacrifice everything,\ncomfort, home, money, love, honour, duty, for the sake of getting on to\ncanvas with paint the emotion which the world gave him. It was\nmagnificent, and yet his courage failed him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Thinking of Cronshaw recalled to him the fact that he had not seen him for\na week, and so, when Clutton left him, he wandered along to the cafe in\nwhich he was certain to find the writer. During the first few months of\nhis stay in Paris Philip had accepted as gospel all that Cronshaw said,\nbut Philip had a practical outlook and he grew impatient with the theories\nwhich resulted in</p>",
  "page-691": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">no action. Cronshaw's slim bundle of poetry did not seem\na substantial result for a life which was sordid. Philip could not wrench\nout of his nature the instincts of the middle-class from which he came;\nand the penury, the hack work which Cronshaw did to keep body and soul\ntogether, the monotony of existence between the slovenly attic and the\ncafe table, jarred with his respectability. Cronshaw was astute enough to\nknow that the young man disapproved of him, and he attacked his\nphilistinism with an irony which was sometimes playful but often very\nkeen.</p><p>\"You're a tradesman,\" he told Philip, \"you want to invest life in consols\nso that it shall bring you in a safe three per cent. I'm a spendthrift, I\nrun through my capital. I shall spend my last penny with my last\nheartbeat.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The metaphor irritated Philip, because it assumed for the speaker a\nromantic attitude and cast a slur upon</p>",

I don't see any\nuse in being second-rate.

  "page-693": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">The corners of the mouth\nwere suddenly depressed, the eyes sunk dully in their orbits; he seemed to\nbecome strangely bowed and old.</p><p>\"This?\" he cried, looking round the cafe in which they sat.

He knew that he was looking\nupon the tragedy of failure. There was silence. Philip thought that\nCronshaw was looking upon his own life; and perhaps he considered his\nyouth with its bright hopes and the disappointments which wore out the\nradiancy; the wretched monotony of pleasure, and the black future.\nPhilip's eyes rested on the little pile of saucers, and he knew that\nCronshaw's were on them too.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Now he could go\non with courage; and what did hardship matter, privation, and\ndisappointment, if he arrived at last? He had worked very hard, it would\nbe too cruel if all that industry were futile. And then with a start he\nremembered that he had heard Fanny Price say just that. They arrived at\nthe house, and Philip was seized with fear. If he had dared he would have\nasked Foinet to go away. He did not want to know the truth. They went in\nand the concierge handed him a letter as they passed. He glanced at the\nenvelope and recognised his uncle's</p>",
  "page-699": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">handwriting. Foinet followed him up\nthe stairs. Philip could think of nothing to say; Foinet was mute, and the\nsilence got on his nerves. The professor sat down; and Philip without a\nword placed before him the picture which the Salon had rejected; Foinet\nnodded but did not speak; then Philip showed him the two portraits he had\nmade of Ruth Chalice, two or three landscapes which he had painted at\nMoret, and a number of sketches.</p><p>\"That's all,\" he said presently, with a nervous laugh.</p><p>Monsieur Foinet rolled himself a cigarette and lit it.</p><p>\"You have very little private means?\" he asked at last.</p><p>\"Very little,\" answered Philip, with a sudden feeling of cold at his\nheart. \"Not enough to live on.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"There is nothing so degrading as the constant anxiety about one's means\nof livelihood.

Though he\nhad so greatly disapproved of Philip's desire to go to Paris, he accepted\nthe situation now with equanimity. He was interested in the life of\nstudents and constantly put Philip questions about it. He was in fact a\nlittle proud of him because he was a painter, and when people were present\nmade attempts to draw him out. He looked eagerly at the studies of models\nwhich Philip showed him. Philip set before him his portrait of Miguel\nAjuria.</p><p>\"Why did you paint him?\" asked Mr. Carey.</p><p>\"Oh, I wanted a model, and his head interested me.\"</p><p>\"As you haven't got anything to do here I wonder you don't paint me.\"</p><p>\"It would bore you to sit.\"</p><p>\"I think I should like it.\"</p><p>\"We must see about it.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip was amused at his uncle's vanity. It was clear</p>",
  "page-716": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that he was dying to\nhave his portrait painted. To get something for nothing was a chance not\nto be missed. For two or three days he threw out little hints. He\nreproached Philip for laziness, asked him when he was going to start work,\nand finally began telling everyone he met that Philip was going to paint\nhim. At last there came a rainy day, and after breakfast Mr. Carey said to\nPhilip:</p><p>\"Now, what d'you say to starting on my portrait this morning?\" Philip put\ndown the book he was reading and leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\"I've given up painting,\" he said.</p><p>\"Why?\" asked his uncle in astonishment.</p><p>\"I don't think there's much object in being a second-rate painter, and I\ncame to the conclusion that I should never be anything else.\"</p><p>\"You surprise me. Before you went to Paris you were quite certain that you\nwere a genius.\"</p>",
  "page-717": "<p>\"I was mistaken,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"I should have thought now you'd taken up a profession you'd have the\npride to stick to it. It seems to me that what you lack is perseverance.\"</p><p>Philip was a little annoyed that his uncle did not even see how truly\nheroic his determination was.</p><p>\"'A rolling stone gathers no moss,'\" proceeded the clergyman. Philip hated\nthat proverb above all, and it seemed to him perfectly meaningless. His\nuncle had repeated it often during the arguments which had preceded his\ndeparture from business. Apparently it recalled that occasion to his\nguardian.</p><p>\"You're no longer a boy, you know; you must begin to think of settling\ndown.

Philip was born a generation after this great book was\npublished, and much that horrified its contemporaries had passed into the\nfeeling of the time, so that he was able to accept it with a joyful heart.\nHe was intensely moved by the grandeur of the struggle for life, and the\nethical rule which it suggested seemed to fit in with his predispositions.\nHe said to himself that might was right.

For it was clear that the two were irreconcilable, the state and\nthe individual conscious of himself. THAT uses the individual for its\nown ends, trampling upon him if he thwarts it, rewarding him with medals,\npensions, honours, when he serves it faithfully; THIS, strong only in\nhis independence, threads his way through the state, for convenience'\nsake, paying in money or service for certain benefits, but with no</p>",

Such of the students as\nhad been to a university kept a good deal together: they used a variety of\nmeans natural to the young in order to impress upon the less fortunate a\nproper sense of their inferiority; the rest of the students found their\nOlympian serenity rather hard to bear. Griffiths was a</p>",
  "page-753": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">tall fellow, with\na quantity of curly red hair and blue eyes, a white skin and a very red\nmouth; he was one of those fortunate people whom everybody liked, for he\nhad high spirits and a constant gaiety. He strummed a little on the piano\nand sang comic songs with gusto; and evening after evening, while Philip\nwas reading in his solitary room, he heard the shouts and the uproarious\nlaughter of Griffiths' friends above him. He thought of those delightful\nevenings in Paris when they would sit in the studio, Lawson and he,\nFlanagan and Clutton, and talk of art and morals, the love-affairs of the\npresent, and the fame of the future. He felt sick at heart. He found that\nit was easy to make a heroic gesture, but hard to abide by its results.\nThe worst of it was that the work seemed to him very tedious. He had got\nout of the habit of being asked questions by demonstrators. His attention\nwandered at lectures. Anatomy was a dreary science, a mere matter of\nlearning by heart an enormous</p>",

One man, hearing that he had studied\nart in Paris, and fancying himself on his taste, tried to discuss art with\nhim; but Philip was impatient of views which did not agree with his own;\nand, finding quickly that the other's ideas were conventional, grew\nmonosyllabic.

  "page-758": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">who looked like a\nGerman, was favoured with her attention whenever he came into the shop;\nand then it was only by calling her two or three times that they could\ninduce her to take their order. She used the clients whom she did not know\nwith frigid insolence, and when she was talking to a friend was perfectly\nindifferent to the calls of the hurried. She had the art of treating women\nwho desired refreshment with just that degree of impertinence which\nirritated them without affording them an opportunity of complaining to the\nmanagement.

  "page-761": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">disliked him rather than otherwise, and his\npride was wounded. He could not suppress a desire to be even with her. He\nwas impatient with himself because he had so petty a feeling, but three or\nfour days' firmness, during which he would not go to the shop, did not\nhelp him to surmount it; and he came to the conclusion that it would be\nleast trouble to see her. Having done so he would certainly cease to think\nof her. Pretexting an appointment one afternoon, for he was not a little\nashamed of his weakness, he left Dunsford and went straight to the shop\nwhich he had vowed never again to enter. He saw the waitress the moment he\ncame in and sat down at one of her tables. He expected her to make some\nreference to the fact that he had not been there for a week, but when she\ncame up for his order she said nothing. He had heard her say to other\ncustomers:</p><p>\"You're quite a stranger.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She gave no sign that she had ever seen him before.</p>",

Though no one knew of the\nhumiliation but Dunsford, and he had certainly forgotten, Philip felt that\nhe could have no peace till he had wiped it out. He thought over what he\nhad better do. He made up his mind that he would go to the shop every day;\nit was obvious that he had made a disagreeable impression on her, but he\nthought he had the wits to eradicate it; he would take care not to</p>",
  "page-765": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">say\nanything at which the most susceptible person could be offended. All this\nhe did, but it had no effect. When he went in and said good-evening she\nanswered with the same words, but when once he omitted to say it in order\nto see whether she would say it first, she said nothing at all. He\nmurmured in his heart an expression which though frequently applicable to\nmembers of the female sex is not often used of them in polite society; but\nwith an unmoved face he ordered his tea. He made up his mind not to speak\na word, and left the shop without his usual good-night. He promised\nhimself that he would not go any more, but the next day at tea-time he\ngrew restless. He tried to think of other things, but he had no command\nover his thoughts. At last he said desperately:</p><p>\"After all there's no reason why I shouldn't go if I want to.\"</p><p>The struggle with himself had taken a long time, and it was getting on for\nseven when he entered the shop.</p>",
  "page-766": "<p>\"I thought you weren't coming,\" the girl said to him, when he sat down.</p><p>His heart leaped in his bosom and he felt himself reddening. \"I was\ndetained.

It would be a\ngreat comfort to express</p>",
  "page-767": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the immensity of his contempt. He looked at her.\nIt was true that her profile was beautiful; it was extraordinary how\nEnglish girls of that class had so often a perfection of outline which\ntook your breath away, but it was as cold as marble; and the faint green\nof her delicate skin gave an impression of unhealthiness. All the\nwaitresses were dressed alike, in plain black dresses, with a white apron,\ncuffs, and a small cap. On a half sheet of paper that he had in his pocket\nPhilip made a sketch of her as she sat leaning over her book (she outlined\nthe words with her lips as she read), and left it on the table when he\nwent away. It was an inspiration, for next day, when he came in, she\nsmiled at him.</p><p>\"I didn't know you could draw,\" she said.</p><p>\"I was an art-student in Paris for two years.\"</p><p>\"I showed that drawing you left be'ind you last night to the manageress\nand she WAS struck with it. Was it meant to be me?\"</p>",
  "page-768": "<p>\"It was,\" said Philip.</p><p>When she went for his tea, one of the other girls came up to him.</p><p>\"I saw that picture you done of Miss Rogers. It was the very image of\nher,\" she said.</p><p>That was the first time he had heard her name, and when he wanted his bill\nhe called her by it.</p><p>\"I see you know my name,\" she said, when she came.</p><p>\"Your friend mentioned it when she said something to me about that\ndrawing.\"</p><p>\"She wants you to do one of her. Don't you do it.

Has he gone away?\"</p><p>\"Fancy your remembering him,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"He was a nice-looking young fellow.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip felt quite a peculiar sensation in his heart. He</p>",
  "page-769": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">did not know what\nit was. Dunsford had jolly curling hair, a fresh complexion, and a\nbeautiful smile. Philip thought of these advantages with envy.</p><p>\"Oh, he's in love,\" said he, with a little laugh.</p><p>Philip repeated every word of the conversation to himself as he limped\nhome. She was quite friendly with him now. When opportunity arose he would\noffer to make a more finished sketch of her, he was sure she would like\nthat; her face was interesting, the profile was lovely, and there was\nsomething curiously fascinating about the chlorotic colour. He tried to\nthink what it was like; at first he thought of pea soup; but, driving away\nthat idea angrily, he thought of the petals of a yellow rosebud when you\ntore it to pieces before it had burst. He had no ill-feeling towards her\nnow.</p><p>\"She's not a bad sort,\" he murmured.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was silly of him to take offence at what she had said; it was doubtless\nhis own fault; she had not meant</p>",
  "page-770": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to make herself disagreeable: he ought to\nbe accustomed by now to making at first sight a bad impression on people.\nHe was flattered at the success of his drawing; she looked upon him with\nmore interest now that she was aware of this small talent. He was restless\nnext day. He thought of going to lunch at the tea-shop, but he was certain\nthere would be many people there then, and Mildred would not be able to\ntalk to him. He had managed before this to get out of having tea with\nDunsford, and, punctually at half past four (he had looked at his watch a\ndozen times), he went into the shop.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mildred had her back turned to him.

  "page-771": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">her again; then, growing angry, for he was\nimpatient, he rapped the table loudly with his stick. She approached\nsulkily.</p><p>\"How d'you do?\" he said.</p><p>\"You seem to be in a great hurry.\"</p><p>She looked down at him with the insolent manner which he knew so well.</p><p>\"I say, what's the matter with you?\" he asked.</p><p>\"If you'll kindly give your order I'll get what you want.

Soon she was talking to him</p>",
  "page-772": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">with animation. He was a man of middle\nheight, with the round head of his nation and a sallow face; his moustache\nwas large and bristling; he had on a tail-coat and gray trousers, and he\nwore a massive gold watch-chain. Philip thought the other girls looked\nfrom him to the pair at the table and exchanged significant glances. He\nfelt certain they were laughing at him, and his blood boiled. He detested\nMildred now with all his heart. He knew that the best thing he could do\nwas to cease coming to the tea-shop, but he could not bear to think that\nhe had been worsted in the affair, and he devised a plan to show her that\nhe despised her. Next day he sat down at another table and ordered his tea\nfrom another waitress. Mildred's friend was there again and she was\ntalking to him. She paid no attention to Philip, and so when he went out\nhe chose a moment when she had to cross his path: as he passed he looked\nat her as though he had never seen her before. He repeated this for three\nor</p>",
  "page-773": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">four days. He expected that presently she would take the opportunity to\nsay something to him; he thought she would ask why he never came to one of\nher tables now, and he had prepared an answer charged with all the\nloathing he felt for her. He knew it was absurd to trouble, but he could\nnot help himself. She had beaten him again. The German suddenly\ndisappeared, but Philip still sat at other tables. She paid no attention\nto him. Suddenly he realised that what he did was a matter of complete\nindifference to her; he could go on in that way till doomsday, and it\nwould have no effect.</p><p>\"I've not finished yet,\" he said to himself.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The day after he sat down in his old seat, and when she came up said\ngood-evening as though he had not ignored her for a week.

  "page-774": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">delighted to go to one.</p><p>\"I say,\" he said suddenly, \"I wonder if you'd dine with me one night and\ncome to The Belle of New York.

He\nthought the jokes vulgar and the melodies obvious; it seemed to him that\nthey did these things much better in France; but Mildred enjoyed herself\nthoroughly; she laughed till her sides ached, looking at Philip now and\nthen when something tickled her to exchange a glance of pleasure; and she\napplauded rapturously.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"This is the seventh time I've been,\" she said, after the first act, \"and\nI don't mind if I come seven times</p>",

Crowds poured out of them, clerks and shop-people at that early\nhour, and thronged up the platform: they hurried along, sometimes in\npairs, here and there a group of girls, but more often alone.

  "page-799": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">painful\neagerness, for in the cab on the way from the theatre to the station he\nthought she would let him kiss her.

  "page-800": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">otherwise\ndistressed him; and, thinking her incapable of passion, he looked upon his\nrival as no better off than himself. But his heart sank now, for his first\nthought was that Miller's sudden appearance might interfere with the jaunt\nwhich he had so looked forward to. He entered, sick with apprehension. The\nwaitress came up to him, took his order for tea, and presently brought it.</p><p>\"I'm awfully sorry,\" she said, with an expression on her face of real\ndistress. \"I shan't be able to come tonight after all.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" said Philip.</p><p>\"Don't look so stern about it,\" she laughed. \"It's not my fault. My aunt\nwas taken ill last night, and it's the girl's night out so I must go and\nsit with her. She can't be left alone, can she?\"</p><p>\"It doesn't matter. I'll see you home instead.\"</p><p>\"But you've got the tickets. It would be a pity to waste them.\"</p>",
  "page-801": "<p>He took them out of his pocket and deliberately tore them up.</p><p>\"What are you doing that for?\"</p><p>\"You don't suppose I want to go and see a rotten musical comedy by myself,\ndo you?

Philip knew very little about\nwomen, or he would have been aware that one should accept their most\ntransparent lies. He made up his mind that he would watch the shop and see\nfor certain whether Mildred went out with the German. He had an unhappy\npassion for certainty. At seven he stationed himself on the opposite\npavement.</p>",

He might have been dead. He felt just that same weakness\nnow. He loved the woman so that he knew he had never loved before. He did\nnot mind her faults of person or of character, he thought he loved them\ntoo: at all events they meant nothing to him.

The streets on the South\nside of the river were dingy enough on week-days, but there was an energy,\na coming and going, which gave them a sordid vivacity; but on Sundays,\nwith no shops open, no carts in the roadway, silent and depressed, they\nwere indescribably dreary.

He had given the approaching examination as his\nexcuse, but in point of fact he had been unwilling to leave London and\nMildred. He had neglected his work so much that now he had only a\nfortnight to learn what the curriculum allowed three months for. He set to\nwork seriously. He found it easier each day not to think of Mildred. He\ncongratulated himself on his force of character. The pain he suffered was\nno longer anguish, but a sort of soreness, like what one might be expected\nto feel if one had been thrown off a horse and, though no bones were\nbroken, were bruised all over and shaken.

  "page-814": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">The\nidea filled him with panic, so that he feared Dunsford would see that\nsomething was the matter with him: he could not think of anything to say;\nhe pretended to listen to what Dunsford was talking about; the\nconversation maddened him; and it was all he could do to prevent himself\nfrom crying out to Dunsford for Heaven's sake to hold his tongue.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then came the day of his examination. Philip, when his turn arrived, went\nforward to the examiner's table with the utmost confidence. He answered\nthree or four questions. Then they showed him various specimens; he had\nbeen to very few lectures and, as soon as he was asked about things which\nhe could not learn from books, he was floored. He did what he could to\nhide his ignorance, the examiner did not insist, and soon his ten minutes\nwere over.

He was horribly mortified; and the fact\nthat Dunsford, whom he looked upon as a very pleasant but quite stupid\nfellow, had passed made his own rebuff harder to bear. He had always been\nproud of his intelligence, and now he asked himself desperately whether he\nwas not</p>",

In the three months of\nthe winter session the students who had joined in October had already\nshaken down into groups, and it was clear which were brilliant, which were\nclever or industrious, and which were 'rotters.' Philip was conscious that\nhis failure was a surprise to no one but himself. It was tea-time, and he\nknew that a lot of men would be having tea in the basement of the Medical\nSchool: those who had passed the examination would be exultant, those who\ndisliked him would look at him with satisfaction, and the poor devils who\nhad failed would sympathise with him in order to receive sympathy. His\ninstinct was not to go near the hospital for a week, when the affair would\nbe no more thought of, but, because he hated so much to go just then, he\nwent: he wanted to inflict suffering upon himself.

He thought bitterly that there\nwas small chance of consolation from her; but he wanted to see her even if\nhe did not speak to her; after all, she was a waitress and would be\nobliged to serve him. She was the only person in the world he cared for.\nThere was no use in hiding that fact from himself.

She felt that she had done nothing wrong on that\noccasion. She wanted him now to humble himself. He was very proud. For one\ninstant he felt inclined to tell her to go to hell, but he dared not.

It was a humble establishment, kept by a good man from Rouen\nand his wife, that Philip had discovered by accident.

She restored his\nbelief in himself and put healing ointments, as it were, on all the\nbruises of his soul. He was immensely flattered that she cared for him. He\nadmired her courage, her optimism, her impudent defiance of fate; she had\na little philosophy of her own, ingenuous and practical.</p><p>\"You know, I don't believe in churches and parsons and all that,\" she\nsaid, \"but I believe in God, and I don't believe He minds much about what\nyou do as long as you keep your end up and help a lame dog over a stile\nwhen you can.

One evening, after due\npreparation, he took Philip and Lawson to a tavern situated in Beak\nStreet, remarkable not only in itself and for its history—it had memories\nof eighteenth-century glories which excited the romantic imagination—but\nfor its snuff, which was</p>",
  "page-913": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the best in London, and above all for its punch.\nHayward led them into a large, long room, dingily magnificent, with huge\npictures on the walls of nude women: they were vast allegories of the\nschool of Haydon; but smoke, gas, and the London atmosphere had given them\na richness which made them look like old masters. The dark panelling, the\nmassive, tarnished gold of the cornice, the mahogany tables, gave the room\nan air of sumptuous comfort, and the leather-covered seats along the wall\nwere soft and easy. There was a ram's head on a table opposite the door,\nand this contained the celebrated snuff. They ordered punch. They drank\nit. It was hot rum punch. The pen falters when it attempts to treat of the\nexcellence thereof; the sober vocabulary, the sparse epithet of this\nnarrative, are inadequate to the task; and pompous terms, jewelled, exotic\nphrases rise to the excited fancy. It warmed the blood and cleared the\nhead; it filled the soul with</p>",
  "page-914": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">well-being; it disposed the mind at once to\nutter wit and to appreciate the wit of others; it had the vagueness of\nmusic and the precision of mathematics. Only one of its qualities was\ncomparable to anything else: it had the warmth of a good heart; but its\ntaste, its smell, its feel, were not to be described in words. Charles\nLamb, with his infinite tact, attempting to, might have drawn charming\npictures of the life of his day; Lord Byron in a stanza of Don Juan,\naiming at the impossible, might have achieved the sublime; Oscar Wilde,\nheaping jewels of Ispahan upon brocades of Byzantium, might have created\na troubling beauty. Considering it, the mind reeled under visions of the\nfeasts of Elagabalus; and the subtle harmonies of Debussy mingled with the\nmusty, fragrant romance of chests in which have been kept old clothes,\nruffs, hose, doublets, of a forgotten generation, and the wan odour of\nlilies of the valley and the savour of Cheddar cheese.</p>",
  "page-915": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Hayward discovered the tavern at which this priceless beverage was to be\nobtained by meeting in the street a man called Macalister who had been at\nCambridge with him. He was a stockbroker and a philosopher. He was\naccustomed to go to the tavern once a week; and soon Philip, Lawson, and\nHayward got into the habit of meeting there every Tuesday evening: change\nof manners made it now little frequented, which was an advantage to\npersons who took pleasure in conversation. Macalister was a big-boned\nfellow, much too short for his width, with a large, fleshy face and a soft\nvoice. He was a student of Kant and judged everything from the standpoint\nof pure reason. He was fond of expounding his doctrines. Philip listened\nwith excited interest. He had long come to the conclusion that nothing\namused him more than metaphysics, but he was not so sure of their efficacy\nin the affairs of life. The neat little system which he had</p>",
  "page-916": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">formed as the\nresult of his meditations at Blackstable had not been of conspicuous use\nduring his infatuation for Mildred. He could not be positive that reason\nwas much help in the conduct of life. It seemed to him that life lived\nitself. He remembered very vividly the violence of the emotion which had\npossessed him and his inability, as if he were tied down to the ground\nwith ropes, to react against it. He read many wise things in books, but he\ncould only judge from his own experience (he did not know whether he was\ndifferent from other people); he did not calculate the pros and cons of an\naction, the benefits which must befall him if he did it, the harm which\nmight result from the omission; but his whole being was urged on\nirresistibly. He did not act with a part of himself but altogether. The\npower that possessed him seemed to have nothing to do with reason: all\nthat reason did was to point out the methods of obtaining what his whole\nsoul was striving for.</p>",
  "page-917": "<p>Macalister reminded him of the Categorical Imperative.</p><p>\"Act so that every action of yours should be capable of becoming a\nuniversal rule of action for all men.\"</p><p>\"That seems to me perfect nonsense,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"You're a bold man to say that of anything stated by Immanuel Kant,\"\nretorted Macalister.</p><p>\"Why? Reverence for what somebody said is a stultifying quality: there's\na damned sight too much reverence in the world. Kant thought things not\nbecause they were true, but because he was Kant.\"</p><p>\"Well, what is your objection to the Categorical Imperative?\" (They talked\nas though the fate of empires were in the balance.)</p><p>\"It suggests that one can choose one's course by an effort of will. And it\nsuggests that reason is the surest guide. Why should its dictates be any\nbetter than those of passion? They're different. That's all.\"</p>",
  "page-918": "<p>\"You seem to be a contented slave of your passions.\"</p><p>\"A slave because I can't help myself, but not a contented one,\" laughed\nPhilip.</p><p>While he spoke he thought of that hot madness which had driven him in\npursuit of Mildred. He remembered how he had chafed against it and how he\nhad felt the degradation of it.</p><p>\"Thank God, I'm free from all that now,\" he thought.</p><p>And yet even as he said it he was not quite sure whether he spoke\nsincerely. When he was under the influence of passion he had felt a\nsingular vigour, and his mind had worked with unwonted force. He was more\nalive, there was an excitement in sheer being, an eager vehemence of soul,\nwhich made life now a trifle dull. For all the misery he had endured there\nwas a compensation in that sense of rushing, overwhelming existence.</p>",
  "page-919": "<p>But Philip's unlucky words engaged him in a discussion on the freedom of\nthe will, and Macalister, with his well-stored memory, brought out\nargument after argument. He had a mind that delighted in dialectics, and\nhe forced Philip to contradict himself; he pushed him into corners from\nwhich he could only escape by damaging concessions; he tripped him up with\nlogic and battered him with authorities.</p><p>At last Philip said:</p><p>\"Well, I can't say anything about other people. I can only speak for\nmyself. The illusion of free will is so strong in my mind that I can't get\naway from it, but I believe it is only an illusion. But it is an illusion\nwhich is one of the strongest motives of my actions. Before I do anything\nI feel that I have choice, and that influences what I do; but afterwards,\nwhen the thing is done, I believe that it was inevitable from all\neternity.\"</p><p>\"What do you deduce from that?\" asked Hayward.</p>",

He could not bear to think\nthat she was hurt or unhappy, and he made up his mind to call on her</p>",
  "page-955": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that\nafternoon. He was almost inclined to reproach her because he had allowed\nhimself to get on such intimate terms with her.

  "page-956": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Then he thought of her anguish, for he knew she\nloved him; it had flattered him before, and he was immensely grateful; but\nnow it was horrible. She had not deserved that he should inflict pain upon\nher. He asked himself how she would greet him now, and as he walked up the\nstairs all possible forms of her behaviour flashed across his mind. He\nknocked at the door. He felt that he was pale, and wondered how to conceal\nhis nervousness.</p><p>She was writing away industriously, but she sprang to her feet as he\nentered.</p><p>\"I recognised your step,\" she cried. \"Where have you been hiding yourself,\nyou naughty boy?\"</p><p>She came towards him joyfully and put her arms round his neck. She was\ndelighted to see him. He kissed her, and then, to give himself\ncountenance, said he was dying for tea. She bustled the fire to make the\nkettle boil.</p><p>\"I've been awfully busy,\" he said lamely.</p>",
  "page-957": "<p>She began to chatter in her bright way, telling him of a new commission\nshe had to provide a novelette for a firm which had not hitherto employed\nher. She was to get fifteen guineas for it.</p><p>\"It's money from the clouds. I'll tell you what we'll do, we'll stand\nourselves a little jaunt.

She made some\ntoast for him, and cut it into little pieces, and gave it him as though he\nwere a child.</p><p>\"Is the brute fed?\" she asked.</p><p>He nodded, smiling; and she lit a cigarette for him. Then, as she loved to\ndo, she came and sat on his knees. She was very light. She leaned back in\nhis arms with a sigh of delicious happiness.</p>",
  "page-958": "<p>\"Say something nice to me,\" she murmured.</p><p>\"What shall I say?\"</p><p>\"You might by an effort of imagination say that you rather liked me.\"</p><p>\"You know I do that.\"</p><p>He had not the heart to tell her then. He would give her peace at all\nevents for that day, and perhaps he might write to her. That would be\neasier. He could not bear to think of her crying. She made him kiss her,\nand as he kissed her he thought of Mildred and Mildred's pale, thin lips.\nThe recollection of Mildred remained with him all the time, like an\nincorporated form, but more substantial than a shadow; and the sight\ncontinually distracted his attention.</p><p>\"You're very quiet today,\" Norah said.</p><p>Her loquacity was a standing joke between them, and he answered:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You never let me get a word in, and I've got out of</p>",

While she talked he thought that she was worth ten of Mildred;\nshe amused him much more and was jollier to talk to; she was cleverer, and\nshe had a much nicer nature. She was a good, brave, honest little woman;\nand Mildred, he thought bitterly, deserved none of these</p>",
  "page-960": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">epithets. If he\nhad any sense he would stick to Norah, she would make him much happier\nthan he would ever be with Mildred: after all she loved him, and Mildred\nwas only grateful for his help. But when all was said the important thing\nwas to love rather than to be loved; and he yearned for Mildred with his\nwhole soul. He would sooner have ten minutes with her than a whole\nafternoon with Norah, he prized one kiss of her cold lips more than all\nNorah could give him.</p><p>\"I can't help myself,\" he thought. \"I've just got her in my bones.\"</p><p>He did not care if she was heartless, vicious and vulgar, stupid and\ngrasping, he loved her. He would rather have misery with the one than\nhappiness with the other.</p><p>When he got up to go Norah said casually:</p><p>\"Well, I shall see you tomorrow, shan't I?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he answered.</p>",
  "page-961": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He knew that he would not be able to come, since he was going to help\nMildred with her moving, but he had not the courage to say so.

She had a trunk for her clothes and another for the various odds\nand ends, cushions, lampshades, photograph frames, with which she had\ntried to give the apartments a home-like air; she had two or three large\ncardboard boxes besides, but in all there was no more than could be put on\nthe roof of a four-wheeler. As they drove through Victoria Street Philip\nsat well back in the cab in case Norah should happen to be passing.

He made up his\nmind that he had better go in and see her for half an hour; but the\nnecessity irritated him: he was angry with Norah, because she forced him\nto vulgar and degrading shifts. But he was happy to be with Mildred. It\namused him to help her with the unpacking; and he experienced a charming\nsense of possession in installing her in these lodgings which he had found\nand was paying for. He would not let her exert herself. It was a pleasure\nto do things for her, and she had no desire to do what somebody else\nseemed desirous to do for her. He unpacked her clothes and put them away.\nShe was not proposing to go out again, so he got her slippers and took off\nher boots. It delighted him to perform menial offices.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You do spoil me,\" she said, running her fingers affectionately through\nhis hair, while he was on his</p>",

His sex meant\nnothing to her. But his heart was filled with gratitude for the intimacy\nher request showed. He undid the hooks and eyes with clumsy fingers.</p><p>\"That first day I came into the shop I never thought I'd be doing this for\nyou now,\" he said, with a laugh which he forced.</p><p>\"Somebody must do it,\" she answered.</p>",
  "page-964": "<p>She went into the bed-room and slipped into a pale blue tea-gown decorated\nwith a great deal of cheap lace.

He thought he had better break the fact to Norah at\nonce that he could not stay more than a few minutes.</p><p>\"I say, I've got only just time to say how d'you do,\" he said, as soon as\nhe got into her rooms. \"I'm frightfully busy.\"</p>",
  "page-965": "<p>Her face fell.</p><p>\"Why, what's the matter?\"</p><p>It exasperated him that she should force him to tell lies, and he knew\nthat he reddened when he answered that there was a demonstration at the\nhospital which he was bound to go to. He fancied that she looked as though\nshe did not believe him, and this irritated him all the more.</p><p>\"Oh, well, it doesn't matter,\" she said. \"I shall have you all tomorrow.\"</p><p>He looked at her blankly.

She\nwrote:</p><p>Dearest,</p><p>I'm sorry I was cross on Saturday. Forgive me and come to tea in the\nafternoon as usual. I love you.</p><p>Your Norah.</p><p>His heart sank, and he did not know what to do. He took the note to\nGriffiths and showed it to him.</p><p>\"You'd better leave it unanswered,\" said he.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Oh, I can't,\" cried Philip. \"I should be miserable if I</p>",

I do, and I can't expose anybody else to that torture.\"</p><p>\"My dear fellow, one can't break that sort of affair off without somebody\nsuffering. You must just set your teeth to that. One thing is, it doesn't\nlast very long.\"</p><p>Philip felt that Norah had not deserved that he should make her suffer;\nand what did Griffiths know about the degrees of anguish she was capable\nof? He remembered his own pain when Mildred had told him she was going to\nbe married. He did not want anyone to experience what he had experienced\nthen.</p><p>\"If you're so anxious not to give her pain, go back to her,\" said\nGriffiths.</p><p>\"I can't do that.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He got up and walked up and down the room nervously. He was angry with\nNorah because she had not let the matter rest. She must have seen that he\nhad</p>",
  "page-975": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">no more love to give her. They said women were so quick at seeing\nthose things.</p><p>\"You might help me,\" he said to Griffiths.</p><p>\"My dear fellow, don't make such a fuss about it. People do get over these\nthings, you know. She probably isn't so wrapped up in you as you think,\neither. One's always rather apt to exaggerate the passion one's inspired\nother people with.\"</p><p>He paused and looked at Philip with amusement.</p><p>\"Look here, there's only one thing you can do. Write to her, and tell her\nthe thing's over. Put it so that there can be no mistake about it. It'll\nhurt her, but it'll hurt her less if you do the thing brutally than if you\ntry half-hearted ways.\"</p><p>Philip sat down and wrote the following letter:</p><p>My dear Norah,</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I am sorry to make you unhappy, but I think we had better let things\nremain where we left them on Saturday.</p>",
  "page-976": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">I don't think there's any use in\nletting these things drag on when they've ceased to be amusing. You told\nme to go and I went. I do not propose to come back.

He did not say\nwhat he felt.</p><p>\"I think that'll do the trick,\" he said.</p><p>Philip went out and posted it. He passed an uncomfortable morning, for he\nimagined with great detail what Norah would feel when she received his\nletter. He tortured himself with the thought of her tears. But at the same\ntime he was relieved. Imagined grief was more easy to bear than grief\nseen, and he was free now to love Mildred with all his soul. His heart\nleaped at the thought of going to see her that afternoon, when his day's\nwork at the hospital was over.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When as usual he went back to his rooms to tidy</p>",

There was no trace of resentment in her voice and nothing to\nindicate that there was a rupture between them. He felt himself cornered.\nHe was sick with fear, but he did his best to smile.</p><p>\"Yes, do,\" he said.</p><p>He opened the door, and she preceded him into his sitting-room. He was\nnervous and, to give himself countenance, offered her a cigarette and lit\none for himself. She looked at him brightly.</p><p>\"Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy? If I'd taken\nit seriously it would have made me perfectly wretched.\"</p>",
  "page-978": "<p>\"It was meant seriously,\" he answered gravely.</p><p>\"Don't be so silly. I lost my temper the other day, and I wrote and\napologised. You weren't satisfied, so I've come here to apologise again.\nAfter all, you're your own master and I have no claims upon you. I don't\nwant you to do anything you don't want to.\"</p><p>She got up from the chair in which she was sitting and went towards him\nimpulsively, with outstretched hands.</p><p>\"Let's make friends again, Philip. I'm so sorry if I offended you.\"</p><p>He could not prevent her from taking his hands, but he could not look at\nher.</p><p>\"I'm afraid it's too late,\" he said.</p><p>She let herself down on the floor by his side and clasped his knees.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Philip, don't be silly.

She looked at him steadily for a time which seemed\nintolerable. She was sitting on the floor where he had left her, leaning\nagainst the arm-chair. She began to cry quite silently, without trying to\nhide her face, and the large tears rolled down her cheeks one after the\nother. She did not sob. It was horribly painful to see her. Philip turned\naway.</p>",
  "page-980": "<p>\"I'm awfully sorry to hurt you. It's not my fault if I don't love you.\"</p><p>She did not answer. She merely sat there, as though she were overwhelmed,\nand the tears flowed down her cheeks. It would have been easier to bear if\nshe had reproached him. He had thought her temper would get the better of\nher, and he was prepared for that. At the back of his mind was a feeling\nthat a real quarrel, in which each said to the other cruel things, would\nin some way be a justification of his behaviour. The time passed. At last\nhe grew frightened by her silent crying; he went into his bed-room and got\na glass of water; he leaned over her.</p><p>\"Won't you drink a little? It'll relieve you.\"</p><p>She put her lips listlessly to the glass and drank two or three mouthfuls.\nThen in an exhausted whisper she asked him for a handkerchief. She dried\nher eyes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Of course I knew you never loved me as much as I</p>",
  "page-981": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">loved you,\" she moaned.</p><p>\"I'm afraid that's always the case,\" he said. \"There's always one who\nloves and one who lets himself be loved.\"</p><p>He thought of Mildred, and a bitter pain traversed his heart. Norah did\nnot answer for a long time.</p><p>\"I'd been so miserably unhappy, and my life was so hateful,\" she said at\nlast.</p><p>She did not speak to him, but to herself. He had never heard her before\ncomplain of the life she had led with her husband or of her poverty. He\nhad always admired the bold front she displayed to the world.</p><p>\"And then you came along and you were so good to me. And I admired you\nbecause you were clever and it was so heavenly to have someone I could put\nmy trust in. I loved you. I never thought it could come to an end.

She\nlooked so ill that he had not the heart to let her go alone.</p><p>\"I'll drive back with you if you don't mind.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She did not answer, and he got into the cab.

The good-hearted little woman was touched and found no\ntrouble too great to make Mildred comfortable. Mildred's sense of\npropriety had suggested that Philip should pass himself off as her\nbrother. They dined together, and Philip was delighted when he had ordered\nsomething which tempted Mildred's capricious appetite. It enchanted him to\nsee her sitting opposite him, and every now and then from sheer joy he\ntook her hand and pressed it.

But the rest of the day she spent quite happily on\nher sofa, reading one novel after another or chatting with the landlady;\nshe had an inexhaustible interest in gossip, and told Philip with abundant\ndetail the history of the landlady, of the lodgers on the drawing-room\nfloor, and of the people</p>",

Philip was anxious that\nMildred should keep the child with her, but she refused: she had her\nliving to earn, and it would be more easy to do this if she had not also\nto look after a baby. Her plan was to get back into one of the shops of\nthe company for which she had worked before, and the child could be put\nwith some decent woman in the country.</p><p>\"I can find someone who'll look after it well for seven and sixpence a\nweek.

  "page-992": "<p>\"You know I don't care how much I pay.\"</p><p>At the bottom of her heart was the hope that the child would be\nstill-born.

I can't believe it's mine.\"</p><p>It was red and wrinkled and odd. Philip smiled when he looked at it. He\ndid not quite know what to say; and it embarrassed him because the nurse\nwho owned the house was standing by his side; and he felt by the way she\nwas looking at him that, disbelieving Mildred's complicated story, she\nthought he was the father.</p><p>\"What are you going to call her?\" asked Philip.</p>",

Finally he thanked\nher for consenting to lunch with him next day and said he was dreadfully\nimpatient to see her. Philip noticed that the letter was dated the night\nbefore; Griffiths must have written it after leaving Philip, and had taken\nthe trouble to go out and post it when Philip thought he was in bed.</p><p>He read it with a sickening palpitation of his heart, but gave no outward\nsign of surprise. He handed it back to Mildred with a smile, calmly.</p><p>\"Did you enjoy your lunch?\"</p><p>\"Rather,\" she said emphatically.</p><p>He felt that his hands were trembling, so he put them under the table.</p>",

He had spent the morning in the\nclub of the Medical School, reading one newspaper after another. It was\nthe vacation and few students he knew were in London, but he found one or\ntwo people to talk to, he played a game of chess, and so wore out the\ntedious hours. After luncheon he felt so tired, his head was aching so,\nthat he went back to his lodgings and lay down; he tried to read a novel.\nHe had not seen Griffiths. He was not in when Philip returned the</p>",
  "page-1051": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">night\nbefore; he heard him come back, but he did not as usual look into Philip's\nroom to see if he was asleep; and in the morning Philip heard him go out\nearly. It was clear that he wanted to avoid him. Suddenly there was a\nlight tap at his door. Philip sprang to his feet and opened it. Mildred\nstood on the threshold. She did not move.</p><p>\"Come in,\" said Philip.</p><p>He closed the door after her. She sat down. She hesitated to begin.</p><p>\"Thank you for giving me that two shillings last night,\" she said.</p><p>\"Oh, that's all right.\"</p><p>She gave him a faint smile. It reminded Philip of the timid, ingratiating\nlook of a puppy that has been beaten for naughtiness and wants to\nreconcile himself with his master.</p><p>\"I've been lunching with Harry,\" she said.</p>",
  "page-1052": "<p>\"Have you?\"</p><p>\"If you still want me to go away with you on Saturday, Philip, I'll come.\"</p><p>A quick thrill of triumph shot through his heart, but it was a sensation\nthat only lasted an instant; it was followed by a suspicion.</p><p>\"Because of the money?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Partly,\" she answered simply. \"Harry can't do anything. He owes five\nweeks here, and he owes you seven pounds, and his tailor's pressing him\nfor money. He'd pawn anything he could, but he's pawned everything\nalready. I had a job to put the woman off about my new dress, and on\nSaturday there's the book at my lodgings, and I can't get work in five\nminutes. It always means waiting some little time till there's a vacancy.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She said all this in an even, querulous tone, as though she were\nrecounting the injustices of fate, which</p>",
  "page-1053": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">had to be borne as part of the\nnatural order of things. Philip did not answer. He knew what she told him\nwell enough.</p><p>\"You said partly,\" he observed at last.</p><p>\"Well, Harry says you've been a brick to both of us. You've been a real\ngood friend to him, he says, and you've done for me what p'raps no other\nman would have done. We must do the straight thing, he says. And he said\nwhat you said about him, that he's fickle by nature, he's not like you,\nand I should be a fool to throw you away for him. He won't last and you\nwill, he says so himself.\"</p><p>\"D'you WANT to come away with me?\" asked Philip.</p><p>\"I don't mind.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He looked at her, and the corners of his mouth turned down in an\nexpression of misery. He had triumphed indeed, and he was going to have\nhis way. He</p>",
  "page-1054": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">gave a little laugh of derision at his own humiliation. She\nlooked at him quickly, but did not speak.</p><p>\"I've looked forward with all my soul to going away with you, and I\nthought at last, after all that wretchedness, I was going to be happy...\"</p><p>He did not finish what he was going to say. And then on a sudden, without\nwarning, Mildred broke into a storm of tears. She was sitting in the chair\nin which Norah had sat and wept, and like her she hid her face on the back\nof it, towards the side where there was a little bump formed by the\nsagging in the middle, where the head had rested.</p><p>\"I'm not lucky with women,\" thought Philip.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Her thin body was shaken with sobs. Philip had never seen a woman cry with\nsuch an utter abandonment. It was horribly painful, and his heart was\ntorn. Without realising what he did, he went up to her and put his arms\nround her; she did not resist, but in</p>",
  "page-1055": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">her wretchedness surrendered herself\nto his comforting. He whispered to her little words of solace. He scarcely\nknew what he was saying, he bent over her and kissed her repeatedly.</p><p>\"Are you awfully unhappy?\" he said at last.</p><p>\"I wish I was dead,\" she moaned. \"I wish I'd died when the baby come.\"</p><p>Her hat was in her way, and Philip took it off for her. He placed her head\nmore comfortably in the chair, and then he went and sat down at the table\nand looked at her.</p><p>\"It is awful, love, isn't it?\" he said. \"Fancy anyone wanting to be in\nlove.\"</p><p>Presently the violence of her sobbing diminished and she sat in the chair,\nexhausted, with her head thrown back and her arms hanging by her side. She\nhad the grotesque look of one of those painters' dummies used to hang\ndraperies on.</p>",
  "page-1056": "<p>\"I didn't know you loved him so much as all that,\" said Philip.</p><p>He understood Griffiths' love well enough, for he put himself in\nGriffiths' place and saw with his eyes, touched with his hands; he was\nable to think himself in Griffiths' body, and he kissed her with his lips,\nsmiled at her with his smiling blue eyes. It was her emotion that\nsurprised him. He had never thought her capable of passion, and this was\npassion: there was no mistaking it. Something seemed to give way in his\nheart; it really felt to him as though something were breaking, and he\nfelt strangely weak.</p><p>\"I don't want to make you unhappy. You needn't come away with me if you\ndon't want to. I'll give you the money all the same.\"</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\"No, I said I'd come, and I'll come.\"</p><p>\"What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?\"</p>",
  "page-1057": "<p>\"Yes, that's the word. I'm sick with love. I know it won't last, just as\nwell as he does, but just now...\"</p><p>She paused and shut her eyes as though she were going to faint. A strange\nidea came to Philip, and he spoke it as it came, without stopping to think\nit out.</p><p>\"Why don't you go away with him?\"</p><p>\"How can I? You know we haven't got the money.\"</p><p>\"I'll give you the money.\"</p><p>\"You?\"</p><p>She sat up and looked at him. Her eyes began to shine, and the colour came\ninto her cheeks.</p><p>\"Perhaps the best thing would be to get it over, and then you'd come back\nto me.\"</p><p>Now that he had made the suggestion he was sick with anguish, and yet the\ntorture of it gave him a strange, subtle sensation. She stared at him with\nopen eyes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Oh, how could we, on your money? Harry</p>",
  "page-1058": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">wouldn't think of it.\"</p><p>\"Oh yes, he would, if you persuaded him.\"</p><p>Her objections made him insist, and yet he wanted her with all his heart\nto refuse vehemently.</p><p>\"I'll give you a fiver, and you can go away from Saturday to Monday. You\ncould easily do that. On Monday he's going home till he takes up his\nappointment at the North London.\"</p><p>\"Oh, Philip, do you mean that?\" she cried, clasping her hands. \"If you\ncould only let us go—I would love you so much afterwards, I'd do anything\nfor you. I'm sure I shall get over it if you'll only do that. Would you\nreally give us the money?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said.</p><p>She was entirely changed now. She began to laugh. He could see that she\nwas insanely happy. She got up and knelt down by Philip's side, taking his\nhands.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You are a brick, Philip. You're the best fellow I've</p>",
  "page-1059": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ever known. Won't\nyou be angry with me afterwards?\"</p><p>He shook his head, smiling, but with what agony in his heart!</p><p>\"May I go and tell Harry now? And can I say to him that you don't mind? He\nwon't consent unless you promise it doesn't matter. Oh, you don't know how\nI love him! And afterwards I'll do anything you like. I'll come over to\nParis with you or anywhere on Monday.\"</p><p>She got up and put on her hat.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"I'm going to ask him if he'll take me.\"</p><p>\"Already?\"</p><p>\"D'you want me to stay? I'll stay if you like.\"</p><p>She sat down, but he gave a little laugh.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"No, it doesn't matter, you'd better go at once. There's only one thing:\nI can't bear to see Griffiths just now, it would hurt me too awfully. Say\nI have no ill-feeling towards him or anything like that, but ask him</p>",
  "page-1060": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to\nkeep out of my way.\"</p><p>\"All right.\" She sprang up and put on her gloves. \"I'll let you know what\nhe says.\"</p><p>\"You'd better dine with me tonight.\"</p><p>\"Very well.\"</p><p>She put up her face for him to kiss her, and when he pressed his lips to\nhers she threw her arms round his neck.</p><p>\"You are a darling, Philip.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She sent him a note a couple of hours later to say that she had a headache\nand could not dine with him. Philip had almost expected it. He knew that\nshe was dining with Griffiths. He was horribly jealous, but the sudden\npassion which had seized the pair of them seemed like something that had\ncome from the outside, as though a god had visited them with it, and he\nfelt himself helpless. It seemed so natural that they should love one\nanother. He saw all the advantages that</p>",
  "page-1061": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Griffiths had over himself and\nconfessed that in Mildred's place he would have done as Mildred did. What\nhurt him most was Griffiths' treachery; they had been such good friends,\nand Griffiths knew how passionately devoted he was to Mildred: he might\nhave spared him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He did not see Mildred again till Friday; he was sick for a sight of her\nby then; but when she came and he realised that he had gone out of her\nthoughts entirely, for they were engrossed in Griffiths, he suddenly hated\nher. He saw now why she and Griffiths loved one another, Griffiths was\nstupid, oh so stupid! he had known that all along, but had shut his eyes\nto it, stupid and empty-headed: that charm of his concealed an utter\nselfishness; he was willing to sacrifice anyone to his appetites. And how\ninane was the life he led, lounging about bars and drinking in music\nhalls, wandering from one light amour to another! He never read a book,</p>",
  "page-1062": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he\nwas blind to everything that was not frivolous and vulgar; he had never a\nthought that was fine: the word most common on his lips was smart; that\nwas his highest praise for man or woman. Smart! It was no wonder he\npleased Mildred. They suited one another.</p><p>Philip talked to Mildred of things that mattered to neither of them. He\nknew she wanted to speak of Griffiths, but he gave her no opportunity. He\ndid not refer to the fact that two evenings before she had put off dining\nwith him on a trivial excuse. He was casual with her, trying to make her\nthink he was suddenly grown indifferent; and he exercised peculiar skill\nin saying little things which he knew would wound her; but which were so\nindefinite, so delicately cruel, that she could not take exception to\nthem. At last she got up.</p><p>\"I think I must be going off now,\" she said.</p><p>\"I daresay you've got a lot to do,\" he answered.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She held out her hand, he took it, said good-bye, and</p>",
  "page-1063": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">opened the door for\nher. He knew what she wanted to speak about, and he knew also that his\ncold, ironical air intimidated her. Often his shyness made him seem so\nfrigid that unintentionally he frightened people, and, having discovered\nthis, he was able when occasion arose to assume the same manner.</p><p>\"You haven't forgotten what you promised?\" she said at last, as he held\nopen the door.</p><p>\"What is that?\"</p><p>\"About the money.\"</p><p>\"How much d'you want?\"</p><p>He spoke with an icy deliberation which made his words peculiarly\noffensive. Mildred flushed. He knew she hated him at that moment, and he\nwondered at the self-control by which she prevented herself from flying\nout at him. He wanted to make her suffer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"There's the dress and the book tomorrow. That's all. Harry won't come, so\nwe shan't want money for</p>",
  "page-1064": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that.\"</p><p>Philip's heart gave a great thud against his ribs, and he let the door\nhandle go. The door swung to.</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"He says we couldn't, not on your money.\"</p><p>A devil seized Philip, a devil of self-torture which was always lurking\nwithin him, and, though with all his soul he wished that Griffiths and\nMildred should not go away together, he could not help himself; he set\nhimself to persuade Griffiths through her.</p><p>\"I don't see why not, if I'm willing,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's what I told him.\"</p><p>\"I should have thought if he really wanted to go he wouldn't hesitate.\"</p><p>\"Oh, it's not that, he wants to all right. He'd go at once if he had the\nmoney.\"</p><p>\"If he's squeamish about it I'll give YOU the money.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I said you'd lend it if he liked, and we'd pay it back</p>",
  "page-1065": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">as soon as we\ncould.\"</p><p>\"It's rather a change for you going on your knees to get a man to take you\naway for a week-end.\"</p><p>\"It is rather, isn't it?\" she said, with a shameless little laugh. It sent\na cold shudder down Philip's spine.</p><p>\"What are you going to do then?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Nothing. He's going home tomorrow.

Philip remembered the wall-paper from\nhis earliest years. On the walls were quaint water colours of the early\nVictorian period by a friend of the Vicar's youth. They had a faded charm.\nThe dressing-table was surrounded by stiff muslin. There was an old\ntall-boy to</p>",

He had become\naccustomed to living without his wife and missed her very little. He\nbickered still with Josiah Graves. Philip went to see the churchwarden. He\nwas a little thinner, a little whiter, a little more austere; he was\nautocratic still and still disapproved of candles on the altar. The shops\nhad still a pleasant quaintness; and Philip stood in front of that in\nwhich things useful to seamen were sold, sea-boots and tarpaulins and\ntackle, and remembered that he had felt there in his childhood the thrill\nof the sea and the adventurous magic of the unknown.</p>",

He did not know what it was that\npassed from a man to a woman, from a woman to a man, and made one of them\na slave: it was convenient to call it the sexual instinct; but if it was\nno more than that, he did not understand why it should occasion so\nvehement an attraction to one person rather than another. It was\nirresistible: the mind could not battle with it; friendship, gratitude,\ninterest, had no power beside it.

He had never understood\nher adventure with Emil Miller: it had seemed so unlike her, and she had\nnever been able to explain it; but now that he had seen her with Griffiths\nhe knew that just the same thing had happened then: she had been carried\noff her feet by an ungovernable desire. He tried to think out what those\ntwo men had which so strangely attracted her. They both had a vulgar\nfacetiousness which tickled her simple sense of humour, and a certain\ncoarseness of nature; but what took her perhaps was the blatant sexuality\nwhich was their most marked characteristic.

The patient stood among them a little\nembarrassed, but not altogether displeased to find himself the centre of\nattention: he listened confusedly while Dr. Tyrell discoursed glibly on\nthe case.

Dr. Tyrell and his house-physician got through them\nquickly. Time was getting on, and the air in the small</p>",

He\nfound the work of absorbing interest. There was humanity there in the\nrough, the materials the artist worked on; and Philip felt a curious\nthrill when it occurred to him that he was in the position of the artist\nand the patients were like clay in his hands. He</p>",
  "page-1134": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">remembered with an amused\nshrug of the shoulders his life in Paris, absorbed in colour, tone,\nvalues, Heaven knows what, with the aim of producing beautiful things: the\ndirectness of contact with men and women gave a thrill of power which he\nhad never known.

Often you could guess their trades by the look of them.\nYou learnt in what way to put your questions so that they should be\nunderstood, you discovered on what subjects nearly all lied, and by what\ninquiries you could extort the truth notwithstanding. You saw the\ndifferent way people took the same things. The diagnosis of dangerous\nillness would be accepted by one with a laugh and a joke, by another with\ndumb despair. Philip found that he was less shy with these people than he\nhad</p>",
  "page-1135": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ever been with others; he felt not exactly sympathy, for sympathy\nsuggests condescension; but he felt at home with them. He found that he\nwas able to put them at their ease, and, when he had been given a case to\nfind out what he could about it, it seemed to him that the patient\ndelivered himself into his hands with a peculiar confidence.</p><p>\"Perhaps,\" he thought to himself, with a smile, \"perhaps I'm cut out to be\na doctor.

To the others men and women were only cases, good if\nthey were complicated, tiresome if obvious; they heard murmurs and were\nastonished at abnormal livers; an unexpected sound in the lungs gave them\nsomething to talk about. But to Philip there was much more. He found an\ninterest in just looking at them, in the shape of their</p>",
  "page-1136": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">heads and their\nhands, in the look of their eyes and the length of their noses. You saw in\nthat room human nature taken by surprise, and often the mask of custom was\ntorn off rudely, showing you the soul all raw. Sometimes you saw an\nuntaught stoicism which was profoundly moving. Once Philip saw a man,\nrough and illiterate, told his case was hopeless; and, self-controlled\nhimself, he wondered at the splendid instinct which forced the fellow to\nkeep a stiff upper-lip before strangers. But was it possible for him to be\nbrave when he was by himself, face to face with his soul, or would he then\nsurrender to despair? Sometimes there was tragedy. Once a young woman\nbrought her sister to be examined, a girl of eighteen, with delicate\nfeatures and large blue eyes, fair hair that sparkled with gold when a ray\nof autumn sunshine touched it for a moment, and a skin of amazing beauty.\nThe students' eyes went to her with little smiles. They did not often see\na pretty girl in</p>",

The elder woman gave the family\nhistory, father and mother had died of phthisis, a brother and a sister,\nthese two were the only ones left. The girl had been coughing lately and\nlosing weight. She took off her blouse and the skin of her neck was like\nmilk. Dr. Tyrell examined her quietly, with his usual rapid method; he\ntold two or three of his clerks to apply their stethoscopes to a place he\nindicated with his finger; and then she was allowed to dress. The sister\nwas standing a little apart and she spoke to him in a low voice, so that\nthe girl should not hear. Her voice trembled with fear.</p><p>\"She hasn't got it, doctor, has she?\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid there's no doubt about it.\"</p><p>\"She was the last one.

It would involve him in a little expense and he could\nnot afford even the smallest increase of expenditure; but on the other\nhand this was a case where it revolted him to think of economy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I say, I can't bear the thought of your remaining</p>",

  "page-1163": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">morning to arrange the change. He found\nCronshaw dressed, sitting in his hat and great-coat on the bed, with a\nsmall, shabby portmanteau, containing his clothes and books, already\npacked: it was on the floor by his feet, and he looked as if he were\nsitting in the waiting-room of a station. Philip laughed at the sight of\nhim. They went over to Kennington in a four-wheeler, of which the windows\nwere carefully closed, and Philip installed his guest in his own room. He\nhad gone out early in the morning and bought for himself a second-hand\nbedstead, a cheap chest of drawers, and a looking-glass. Cronshaw settled\ndown at once to correct his proofs. He was much better.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip found him, except for the irritability which was a symptom of his\ndisease, an easy guest. He had a lecture at nine in the morning, so did\nnot see Cronshaw till the night. Once or twice Philip persuaded him to\nshare the scrappy meal he prepared for himself in the</p>",
  "page-1164": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">evening, but\nCronshaw was too restless to stay in, and preferred generally to get\nhimself something to eat in one or other of the cheapest restaurants in\nSoho. Philip asked him to see Dr. Tyrell, but he stoutly refused; he knew\na doctor would tell him to stop drinking, and this he was resolved not to\ndo. He always felt horribly ill in the morning, but his absinthe at\nmid-day put him on his feet again, and by the time he came home, at\nmidnight, he was able to talk with the brilliancy which had astonished\nPhilip when first he made his acquaintance. His proofs were corrected; and\nthe volume was to come out among the publications of the early spring,\nwhen the public might be supposed to have recovered from the avalanche of\nChristmas books.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-1165": "<h3>Lxxxiv.</h3><p class=\" stretch-last-line start-chapter\">At the new year Philip became dresser in the surgical out-patients'\ndepartment. The work was of the same character as that which he had just\nbeen engaged on, but with the greater directness which surgery has than\nmedicine; and a larger proportion of the patients suffered from those two\ndiseases which a supine public allows, in its prudishness, to be spread\nbroadcast. The assistant-surgeon for whom Philip dressed was called\nJacobs. He was a short, fat man, with an exuberant joviality, a bald head,\nand a loud voice; he had a cockney accent, and was generally described</p>",
  "page-1166": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">by\nthe students as an 'awful bounder'; but his cleverness, both as a surgeon\nand as a teacher, caused some of them to overlook this. He had also a\nconsiderable facetiousness, which he exercised impartially on the patients\nand on the students. He took a great pleasure in making his dressers look\nfoolish. Since they were ignorant, nervous, and could not answer as if he\nwere their equal, this was not very difficult. He enjoyed his afternoons,\nwith the home truths he permitted himself, much more than the students who\nhad to put up with them with a smile. One day a case came up of a boy with\na club-foot. His parents wanted to know whether anything could be done.\nMr. Jacobs turned to Philip.</p><p>\"You'd better take this case, Carey. It's a subject you ought to know\nsomething about.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip flushed, all the more because the surgeon spoke obviously with a\nhumorous intention, and his</p>",
  "page-1167": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">brow-beaten dressers laughed obsequiously. It\nwas in point of fact a subject which Philip, since coming to the hospital,\nhad studied with anxious attention. He had read everything in the library\nwhich treated of talipes in its various forms. He made the boy take off\nhis boot and stocking. He was fourteen, with a snub nose, blue eyes, and\na freckled face. His father explained that they wanted something done if\npossible, it was such a hindrance to the kid in earning his living. Philip\nlooked at him curiously. He was a jolly boy, not at all shy, but talkative\nand with a cheekiness which his father reproved. He was much interested in\nhis foot.</p><p>\"It's only for the looks of the thing, you know,\" he said to Philip. \"I\ndon't find it no trouble.\"</p><p>\"Be quiet, Ernie,\" said his father. \"There's too much gas about you.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip examined the foot and passed his hand slowly over the shapelessness\nof it. He could not understand</p>",
  "page-1168": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">why the boy felt none of the humiliation\nwhich always oppressed himself. He wondered why he could not take his\ndeformity with that philosophic indifference. Presently Mr. Jacobs came up\nto him. The boy was sitting on the edge of a couch, the surgeon and Philip\nstood on each side of him; and in a semi-circle, crowding round, were\nstudents. With accustomed brilliancy Jacobs gave a graphic little\ndiscourse upon the club-foot: he spoke of its varieties and of the forms\nwhich followed upon different anatomical conditions.</p><p>\"I suppose you've got talipes equinus?\" he said, turning suddenly to\nPhilip.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip felt the eyes of his fellow-students rest on him, and he cursed\nhimself because he could not help blushing. He felt the sweat start up in\nthe palms of his hands. The surgeon spoke with the fluency due to long\npractice and with the admirable perspicacity which</p>",
  "page-1169": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">distinguished him. He\nwas tremendously interested in his profession. But Philip did not listen.\nHe was only wishing that the fellow would get done quickly. Suddenly he\nrealised that Jacobs was addressing him.</p><p>\"You don't mind taking off your sock for a moment, Carey?\"</p><p>Philip felt a shudder pass through him. He had an impulse to tell the\nsurgeon to go to hell, but he had not the courage to make a scene. He\nfeared his brutal ridicule. He forced himself to appear indifferent.</p><p>\"Not a bit,\" he said.</p><p>He sat down and unlaced his boot. His fingers were trembling and he\nthought he should never untie the knot. He remembered how they had forced\nhim at school to show his foot, and the misery which had eaten into his\nsoul.</p><p>\"He keeps his feet nice and clean, doesn't he?\" said Jacobs, in his\nrasping, cockney voice.</p>",
  "page-1170": "<p>The attendant students giggled. Philip noticed that the boy whom they were\nexamining looked down at his foot with eager curiosity. Jacobs took the\nfoot in his hands and said:</p><p>\"Yes, that's what I thought. I see you've had an operation. When you were\na child, I suppose?\"</p><p>He went on with his fluent explanations. The students leaned over and\nlooked at the foot. Two or three examined it minutely when Jacobs let it\ngo.</p><p>\"When you've quite done,\" said Philip, with a smile, ironically.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He could have killed them all. He thought how jolly it would be to jab a\nchisel (he didn't know why that particular instrument came into his mind)\ninto their necks. What beasts men were!

  "page-1171": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">talked\npartly to the boy's father and partly to the students. Philip put on his\nsock and laced his boot. At last the surgeon finished. But he seemed to\nhave an afterthought and turned to Philip.</p><p>\"You know, I think it might be worth your while to have an operation. Of\ncourse I couldn't give you a normal foot, but I think I can do something.\nYou might think about it, and when you want a holiday you can just come\ninto the hospital for a bit.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip had often asked himself whether anything could be done, but his\ndistaste for any reference to the subject had prevented him from\nconsulting any of the surgeons at the hospital. His reading told him that\nwhatever might have been done when he was a small boy, and then treatment\nof talipes was not as skilful as in the present day, there was small\nchance now of any great benefit. Still it would be worth while if an\noperation made it possible for him to wear a more</p>",
  "page-1172": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ordinary boot and to\nlimp less. He remembered how passionately he had prayed for the miracle\nwhich his uncle had assured him was possible to omnipotence. He smiled\nruefully.</p><p>\"I was rather a simple soul in those days,\" he thought.</p><p>Towards the end of February it was clear that Cronshaw was growing much\nworse. He was no longer able to get up. He lay in bed, insisting that the\nwindow should be closed always, and refused to see a doctor; he would take\nlittle nourishment, but demanded whiskey and cigarettes: Philip knew that\nhe should have neither, but Cronshaw's argument was unanswerable.</p><p>\"I daresay they are killing me. I don't care. You've warned me, you've\ndone all that was necessary: I ignore your warning.

  "page-1173": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and there was something\nof the dead leaf in his appearance which made the word exactly descriptive\nof the manner of his appearance. He was a weedy-looking fellow of\nfive-and-thirty, with long pale hair and a white face; he had the look of\na man who lived too little in the open air. He wore a hat like a\ndissenting minister's. Philip disliked him for his patronising manner and\nwas bored by his fluent conversation. Leonard Upjohn liked to hear himself\ntalk. He was not sensitive to the interest of his listeners, which is the\nfirst requisite of the good talker; and he never realised that he was\ntelling people what they knew already. With measured words he told Philip\nwhat to think of Rodin, Albert Samain, and Caesar Franck. Philip's\ncharwoman only came in for an hour in the morning, and since Philip was\nobliged to be at the hospital all day Cronshaw was left much alone. Upjohn\ntold Philip that he thought someone should remain with him, but did not\noffer to make it possible.</p>",
  "page-1174": "<p>\"It's dreadful to think of that great poet alone.

  "page-1175": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">could only keep his temper\nby remembering all the time that this irritability was a symptom of the\ndisease. Upjohn came sometimes before Philip was in, and then Cronshaw\nwould complain of him bitterly. Upjohn listened with complacency.</p><p>\"The fact is that Carey has no sense of beauty,\" he smiled. \"He has a\nmiddle-class mind.\"</p><p>He was very sarcastic to Philip, and Philip exercised a good deal of\nself-control in his dealings with him. But one evening he could not\ncontain himself. He had had a hard day at the hospital and was tired out.\nLeonard Upjohn came to him, while he was making himself a cup of tea in\nthe kitchen, and said that Cronshaw was complaining of Philip's insistence\nthat he should have a doctor.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Don't you realise that you're enjoying a very rare, a very exquisite\nprivilege?

You should make allowances for the delicate imaginings which\nyou cannot feel.\"</p><p>Philip's face darkened.</p><p>\"Let us go in to Cronshaw,\" he said frigidly.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The poet was lying on his back, reading a book, with a pipe in his mouth.\nThe air was musty; and the room, notwithstanding Philip's tidying up, had\nthe bedraggled look which seemed to accompany Cronshaw wherever he went.\nHe took off his spectacles as they came in.</p>",
  "page-1177": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Philip was in a towering rage.</p><p>\"Upjohn tells me you've been complaining to him because I've urged you to\nhave a doctor,\" he said. \"I want you to have a doctor, because you may die\nany day, and if you hadn't been seen by anyone I shouldn't be able to get\na certificate. There'd have to be an inquest and I should be blamed for\nnot calling a doctor in.\"</p><p>\"I hadn't thought of that. I thought you wanted me to see a doctor for my\nsake and not for your own. I'll see a doctor whenever you like.\"</p><p>Philip did not answer, but gave an almost imperceptible shrug of the\nshoulders. Cronshaw, watching him, gave a little chuckle.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Don't look so angry, my dear. I know very well you want to do everything\nyou can for me. Let's see your doctor, perhaps he can do something for me,\nand at any rate it'll comfort you.\" He turned his eyes to Upjohn. \"You're\na damned fool, Leonard. Why d'you want to</p>",
  "page-1178": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">worry the boy? He has quite\nenough to do to put up with me. You'll do nothing more for me than write\na pretty article about me after my death.

He felt that he was the sort of man to\nbe interested by the story, and as soon as Tyrell was free of his day's\nwork he accompanied Philip to Kennington. He could only agree with what\nPhilip had told him. The case was hopeless.</p><p>\"I'll take him into the hospital if you like,\" he said. \"He can have a\nsmall ward.\"</p><p>\"Nothing would induce him to come.\"</p><p>\"You know, he may die any minute, or else he may get another attack of\npneumonia.\"</p><p>Philip nodded. Dr. Tyrell made one or two suggestions, and promised to\ncome again whenever Philip wanted him to. He left his address. When Philip\nwent back to Cronshaw he found him quietly reading. He did not trouble to\ninquire what the doctor had said.</p>",
  "page-1179": "<p>\"Are you satisfied now, dear boy?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I suppose nothing will induce you to do any of the things Tyrell\nadvised?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" smiled Cronshaw.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

  "page-1181": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of\nthis being done, he held a looking-glass in front of his mouth. It\nstartled him to be alone with Cronshaw.

He wondered whether at that last\nmoment he had been</p>",
  "page-1182": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">seized with the terror of death. Philip imagined\nhimself in such a plight, knowing it was inevitable and with no one, not\na soul, to give an encouraging word when the fear seized him.</p><p>\"You're rather upset,\" said Dr. Tyrell.</p><p>He looked at him with his bright blue eyes. They were not unsympathetic.\nWhen he saw Cronshaw, he said:</p><p>\"He must have been dead for some hours. I should think he died in his\nsleep.

I suppose\nyou'll communicate with the relatives.\"</p><p>\"I don't think there are any,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"How about the funeral?\"</p>",
  "page-1183": "<p>\"Oh, I'll see to that.\"</p><p>Dr. Tyrell gave Philip a glance. He wondered whether he ought to offer a\ncouple of sovereigns towards it. He knew nothing of Philip's\ncircumstances; perhaps he could well afford the expense; Philip might\nthink it impertinent if he made any suggestion.</p><p>\"Well, let me know if there's anything I can do,\" he said.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip and he went out together, parting on the doorstep, and Philip went\nto a telegraph office in order to send a message to Leonard Upjohn. Then\nhe went to an undertaker whose shop he passed every day on his way to the\nhospital. His attention had been drawn to it often by the three words in\nsilver lettering on a black cloth, which, with two model coffins, adorned\nthe window: Economy, Celerity, Propriety. They had always diverted him.\nThe undertaker was a little fat Jew with curly black hair, long and\ngreasy, in black, with a</p>",
  "page-1184": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">large diamond ring on a podgy finger. He received\nPhilip with a peculiar manner formed by the mingling of his natural\nblatancy with the subdued air proper to his calling. He quickly saw that\nPhilip was very helpless and promised to send round a woman at once to\nperform the needful offices. His suggestions for the funeral were very\nmagnificent; and Philip felt ashamed of himself when the undertaker seemed\nto think his objections mean. It was horrible to haggle on such a matter,\nand finally Philip consented to an expensiveness which he could ill\nafford.</p><p>\"I quite understand, sir,\" said the undertaker, \"you don't want any show\nand that—I'm not a believer in ostentation myself, mind you—but you want\nit done gentlemanly-like.

  "page-1185": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the woman came along\nto lay out the corpse. Presently a telegram arrived from Leonard Upjohn.</p><p>Shocked and grieved beyond measure.

She had performed her job, and\nnow she rolled down her sleeves, took off her apron, and put on her\nbonnet. Philip asked her how much he owed her.</p>",
  "page-1186": "<p>\"Well, sir, some give me two and sixpence and some give me five\nshillings.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip was ashamed to give her less than the larger sum. She thanked him\nwith just so much effusiveness as was seemly in presence of the grief he\nmight be supposed to feel, and left him. Philip went back into his\nsitting-room, cleared away the remains of his supper, and sat down to read\nWalsham's Surgery. He found it difficult. He felt singularly nervous.\nWhen there was a sound on the stairs he jumped, and his heart beat\nviolently. That thing in the adjoining room, which had been a man and now\nwas nothing, frightened him. The silence seemed alive, as if some\nmysterious movement were taking place within it; the presence of death\nweighed upon these rooms, unearthly and terrifying: Philip felt a sudden\nhorror for what had once been his friend. He tried to force himself to\nread, but presently pushed away his book in despair. What troubled him</p>",
  "page-1187": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">was\nthe absolute futility of the life which had just ended. It did not matter\nif Cronshaw was alive or dead. It would have been just as well if he had\nnever lived. Philip thought of Cronshaw young; and it needed an effort of\nimagination to picture him slender, with a springing step, and with hair\non his head, buoyant and hopeful. Philip's rule of life, to follow one's\ninstincts with due regard to the policeman round the corner, had not acted\nvery well there: it was because Cronshaw had done this that he had made\nsuch a lamentable failure of existence. It seemed that the instincts could\nnot be trusted. Philip was puzzled, and he asked himself what rule of life\nwas there, if that one was useless, and why people acted in one way rather\nthan in another. They acted according to their emotions, but their\nemotions might be good or bad; it seemed just a chance whether they led to\ntriumph or disaster. Life seemed an inextricable confusion. Men hurried\nhither and thither,</p>",
  "page-1188": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">urged by forces they knew not; and the purpose of it\nall escaped them; they seemed to hurry just for hurrying's sake.</p><p>Next morning Leonard Upjohn appeared with a small wreath of laurel.

It looked like the brim of a hat worn\nby a low comedian in a music-hall.</p><p>\"I'll put it over his heart instead,\" said Upjohn.</p><p>\"You've put it on his stomach,\" remarked Philip.</p><p>Upjohn gave a thin smile.</p><p>\"Only a poet knows where lies a poet's heart,\" he answered.</p><p>They went back into the sitting-room, and Philip told him what\narrangements he had made for the funeral.</p>",
  "page-1189": "<p>\"I hoped you've spared no expense.

Leonard Upjohn in his intricate style drew graceful little\npictures of Cronshaw in the Latin Quarter, talking, writing poetry:\nCronshaw became a picturesque figure, an English Verlaine; and Leonard\nUpjohn's coloured phrases took on a tremulous dignity, a more pathetic\ngrandiloquence, as he described the sordid end, the shabby little room in\nSoho; and, with a reticence which was wholly charming and suggested a much\ngreater generosity than modesty allowed him to state, the efforts he made\nto transport the Poet to some cottage embowered with honeysuckle amid a\nflowering orchard. And the lack of sympathy, well-meaning but so tactless,\nwhich had taken the poet instead to the vulgar respectability of\nKennington!

Beauty from\nashes, he quoted from Isaiah. It was a triumph of irony for that outcast\npoet to die amid the trappings of vulgar respectability; it reminded\nLeonard Upjohn of Christ among the Pharisees, and the analogy gave him\nopportunity for an exquisite passage. And then he told how a friend—his\ngood taste did not suffer him more than to hint subtly who the friend was\nwith such gracious fancies—had laid a laurel wreath on the dead poet's\nheart; and the beautiful dead hands had seemed to rest with a voluptuous\npassion upon Apollo's leaves, fragrant with the fragrance of art, and more\ngreen than jade brought by swart mariners from the manifold, inexplicable\nChina.

He answered the various questions which it was\nPhilip's duty to ask him in a pleasant, educated voice. Since he was lying\nin bed it was difficult to tell if he was short or tall, but his small\nhead and small hands suggested that he was a man of less than average\nheight. Philip had the habit of looking at people's hands, and Athelny's\nastonished him: they were very small, with long, tapering fingers and\nbeautiful, rosy finger-nails; they were very smooth and except for the\njaundice would have been of a surprising whiteness.

Philip had not seen him up before and was\nsurprised at his small size; he was not more than five feet and five\ninches high. He was dressed fantastically in blue linen trousers of the\nsort worn by working men in France, and a very old brown velvet coat; he\nwore a bright red sash round his waist, a low collar, and for tie a\nflowing bow of the kind used by the comic Frenchman in the pages of\nPunch.

They were severe, elegant, and uncomfortable. The only\nother piece of furniture was a bargueno, elaborately ornamented with\ngilt iron-work, on a stand of ecclesiastical design roughly but very\nfinely carved.

Philip was reserved, and it\nembarrassed him to be the recipient of so many confidences. Athelny, with\nhis powerful voice in the diminutive body, with his bombast, with his\nforeign look, with his emphasis, was an astonishing creature. He reminded\nPhilip a good deal of Cronshaw. He appeared to have the same independence\nof thought, the same bohemianism, but he had an infinitely more vivacious\ntemperament; his mind was coarser, and he had not that interest in the\nabstract which made Cronshaw's conversation so captivating. Athelny was\nvery proud of the county family to which he belonged; he showed Philip\nphotographs of an Elizabethan mansion, and told him:</p><p>\"The Athelnys have lived there for seven centuries, my boy.

For him it\nwas an essential part of Spain; and Spain meant much to him, because he\nhad escaped to it from the conventionality which during his married life\nhe had found so irksome. With large gestures and in the emphatic tone\nwhich made what he said so striking, Athelny described to Philip the\nSpanish cathedrals with their vast dark spaces, the massive gold of the\naltar-pieces, and the sumptuous iron-work, gilt and faded, the air laden\nwith incense, the silence: Philip almost saw the Canons in their short\nsurplices of lawn, the acolytes</p>",
  "page-1230": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in red, passing from the sacristy to the\nchoir; he almost heard the monotonous chanting of vespers. The names which\nAthelny mentioned, Avila, Tarragona, Saragossa, Segovia, Cordova, were\nlike trumpets in his heart.

  "page-1232": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">long time, in silence. He stretched\nout his hand for other photographs, and Athelny passed them to him. He had\nnever before seen the work of that enigmatic master; and at the first\nglance he was bothered by the arbitrary drawing: the figures were\nextraordinarily elongated; the heads were very small; the attitudes were\nextravagant. This was not realism, and yet, and yet even in the\nphotographs you had the impression of a troubling reality. Athelny was\ndescribing eagerly, with vivid phrases, but Philip only heard vaguely what\nhe said. He was puzzled. He was curiously moved. These pictures seemed to\noffer some meaning to him, but he did not know what the meaning was. There\nwere portraits of men with large, melancholy eyes which seemed to say you\nknew not what; there were long monks in the Franciscan habit or in the\nDominican, with distraught faces, making gestures whose sense escaped you;\nthere was an Assumption of the Virgin;</p>",
  "page-1233": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">there was a Crucifixion in which\nthe painter by some magic of feeling had been able to suggest that the\nflesh of Christ's dead body was not human flesh only but divine; and there\nwas an Ascension in which the Saviour seemed to surge up towards the\nempyrean and yet to stand upon the air as steadily as though it were solid\nground: the uplifted arms of the Apostles, the sweep of their draperies,\ntheir ecstatic gestures, gave an impression of exultation and of holy joy.\nThe background of nearly all was the sky by night, the dark night of the\nsoul, with wild clouds swept by strange winds of hell and lit luridly by\nan uneasy moon.</p><p>\"I've seen that sky in Toledo over and over again,\" said Athelny. \"I have\nan idea that when first El Greco came to the city it was by such a night,\nand it made so vehement an impression upon him that he could never get\naway from it.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip remembered how Clutton had been affected</p>",
  "page-1234": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">by this strange master,\nwhose work he now saw for the first time. He thought that Clutton was the\nmost interesting of all the people he had known in Paris. His sardonic\nmanner, his hostile aloofness, had made it difficult to know him; but it\nseemed to Philip, looking back, that there had been in him a tragic force,\nwhich sought vainly to express itself in painting. He was a man of unusual\ncharacter, mystical after the fashion of a time that had no leaning to\nmysticism, who was impatient with life because he found himself unable to\nsay the things which the obscure impulses of his heart suggested. His\nintellect was not fashioned to the uses of the spirit. It was not\nsurprising that he felt a deep sympathy with the Greek who had devised a\nnew technique to express the yearnings of his soul. Philip looked again at\nthe series of portraits of Spanish gentlemen, with ruffles and pointed\nbeards, their faces pale against the sober black of their clothes and</p>",
  "page-1235": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\ndarkness of the background. El Greco was the painter of the soul; and\nthese gentlemen, wan and wasted, not by exhaustion but by restraint, with\ntheir tortured minds, seem to walk unaware of the beauty of the world; for\ntheir eyes look only in their hearts, and they are dazzled by the glory of\nthe unseen. No painter has shown more pitilessly that the world is but a\nplace of passage. The souls of the men he painted speak their strange\nlongings through their eyes: their senses are miraculously acute, not for\nsounds and odours and colour, but for the very subtle sensations of the\nsoul. The noble walks with the monkish heart within him, and his eyes see\nthings which saints in their cells see too, and he is unastounded. His\nlips are not lips that smile.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip, silent still, returned to the photograph of Toledo, which seemed\nto him the most arresting picture of them all. He could not take his eyes\noff it. He felt strangely that he was on the threshold of some</p>",
  "page-1236": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">new\ndiscovery in life. He was tremulous with a sense of adventure. He thought\nfor an instant of the love that had consumed him: love seemed very trivial\nbeside the excitement which now leaped in his heart. The picture he looked\nat was a long one, with houses crowded upon a hill; in one corner a boy\nwas holding a large map of the town; in another was a classical figure\nrepresenting the river Tagus; and in the sky was the Virgin surrounded by\nangels. It was a landscape alien to all Philip's notion, for he had lived\nin circles that worshipped exact realism; and yet here again, strangely to\nhimself, he felt a reality greater than any achieved by the masters in\nwhose steps humbly he had sought to walk. He heard Athelny say that the\nrepresentation was so precise that when the citizens of Toledo came to\nlook at the picture they recognised their houses. The painter had painted\nexactly what he saw but he had seen with the eyes of the spirit. There was\nsomething unearthly in that city of pale gray.</p>",
  "page-1237": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">It was a city of the soul\nseen by a wan light that was neither that of night nor day. It stood on a\ngreen hill, but of a green not of this world, and it was surrounded by\nmassive walls and bastions to be stormed by no machines or engines of\nman's invention, but by prayer and fasting, by contrite sighs and by\nmortifications of the flesh. It was a stronghold of God. Those gray houses\nwere made of no stone known to masons, there was something terrifying in\ntheir aspect, and you did not know what men might live in them. You might\nwalk through the streets and be unamazed to find them all deserted, and\nyet not empty; for you felt a presence invisible and yet manifest to every\ninner sense. It was a mystical city in which the imagination faltered like\none who steps out of the light into darkness; the soul walked naked to and\nfro, knowing the unknowable, and conscious strangely of experience,\nintimate but inexpressible, of the absolute. And without surprise, in</p>",
  "page-1238": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that\nblue sky, real with a reality that not the eye but the soul confesses,\nwith its rack of light clouds driven by strange breezes, like the cries\nand the sighs of lost souls, you saw the Blessed Virgin with a gown of red\nand a cloak of blue, surrounded by winged angels. Philip felt that the\ninhabitants of that city would have seen the apparition without\nastonishment, reverent and thankful, and have gone their ways.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Athelny spoke of the mystical writers of Spain, of Teresa de Avila, San\nJuan de la Cruz, Fray Luis de Leon; in all of them was that passion for\nthe unseen which Philip felt in the pictures of El Greco: they seemed to\nhave the power to touch the incorporeal and see the invisible. They were\nSpaniards of their age, in whom were tremulous all the mighty exploits of\na great nation: their fancies were rich with the glories of America and\nthe green islands of the Caribbean Sea; in their veins was the power that\nhad come from age-long battling</p>",
  "page-1239": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">with the Moor; they were proud, for they\nwere masters of the world; and they felt in themselves the wide distances,\nthe tawny wastes, the snow-capped mountains of Castile, the sunshine and\nthe blue sky, and the flowering plains of Andalusia. Life was passionate\nand manifold, and because it offered so much they felt a restless yearning\nfor something more; because they were human they were unsatisfied; and\nthey threw this eager vitality of theirs into a vehement striving after\nthe ineffable. Athelny was not displeased to find someone to whom he could\nread the translations with which for some time he had amused his leisure;\nand in his fine, vibrating voice he recited the canticle of the Soul and\nChrist her lover, the lovely poem which begins with the words en una\nnoche oscura, and the noche serena of Fray Luis de Leon. He had\ntranslated them quite simply, not without skill, and he had found words\nwhich at all events suggested the</p>",
  "page-1240": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">rough-hewn grandeur of the original. The\npictures of El Greco explained them, and they explained the pictures.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip had cultivated a certain disdain for idealism. He had always had a\npassion for life, and the idealism he had come across seemed to him for\nthe most part a cowardly shrinking from it. The idealist withdrew himself,\nbecause he could not suffer the jostling of the human crowd; he had not\nthe strength to fight and so called the battle vulgar; he was vain, and\nsince his fellows would not take him at his own estimate, consoled himself\nwith despising his fellows. For Philip his type was Hayward, fair,\nlanguid, too fat now and rather bald, still cherishing the remains of his\ngood looks and still delicately proposing to do exquisite things in the\nuncertain future; and at the back of this were whiskey and vulgar amours\nof the street. It was in reaction from what Hayward represented that\nPhilip clamoured for life as it stood; sordidness, vice,</p>",
  "page-1241": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">deformity, did\nnot offend him; he declared that he wanted man in his nakedness; and he\nrubbed his hands when an instance came before him of meanness, cruelty,\nselfishness, or lust: that was the real thing. In Paris he had learned\nthat there was neither ugliness nor beauty, but only truth: the search\nafter beauty was sentimental. Had he not painted an advertisement of\nchocolat Menier in a landscape in order to escape from the tyranny of\nprettiness?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But here he seemed to divine something new. He had been coming to it, all\nhesitating, for some time, but only now was conscious of the fact; he felt\nhimself on the brink of a discovery. He felt vaguely that here was\nsomething better than the realism which he had adored; but certainly it\nwas not the bloodless idealism which stepped aside from life in weakness;\nit was too strong; it was virile; it accepted life in all its vivacity,\nugliness and beauty, squalor and heroism; it was realism still; but it</p>",
  "page-1242": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">was\nrealism carried to some higher pitch, in which facts were transformed by\nthe more vivid light in which they were seen. He seemed to see things more\nprofoundly through the grave eyes of those dead noblemen of Castile; and\nthe gestures of the saints, which at first had seemed wild and distorted,\nappeared to have some mysterious significance. But he could not tell what\nthat significance was. It was like a message which it was very important\nfor him to receive, but it was given him in an unknown tongue, and he\ncould not understand. He was always seeking for a meaning in life, and\nhere it seemed to him that a meaning was offered; but it was obscure and\nvague. He was profoundly troubled. He saw what looked like the truth as by\nflashes of lightning on a dark, stormy night you might see a mountain\nrange. He seemed to see that a man need not leave his life to chance, but\nthat his will was powerful; he seemed to see that self-control might be as\npassionate and as</p>",
  "page-1243": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">active as the surrender to passion; he seemed to see\nthat the inward life might be as manifold, as varied, as rich with\nexperience, as the life of one who conquered realms and explored unknown\nlands.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

She had taken off her hat; and in\nher Sunday dress, which seemed a little tight for her, she looked like one\nof the farmers' wives whom Philip used to call on sometimes with his uncle\nwhen he was a small boy.

He had read a great deal, chiefly delighting in books which\nwere unusual; and he poured forth his stores of abstruse knowledge with\nchild-like enjoyment of the amazement of his hearers.

He walked up to Piccadilly Circus in order to\nget a seat; the 'bus waited at the fountain, and when it arrived there\nseldom had more than two or three people in it.

He saw Mildred. He had not thought of her\nfor weeks. She was crossing over from the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and\nstopped at the shelter till a string of cabs passed by. She was watching\nher opportunity and had no eyes for anything else. She wore a large black\nstraw hat with a mass of feathers on it and a black silk dress; at that\ntime it was fashionable for women to wear trains; the road was clear, and\nMildred crossed, her skirt trailing on the ground, and walked down\nPiccadilly. Philip, his heart beating excitedly, followed her. He did not\nwish to speak to her, but he wondered where she was going at that hour; he\nwanted to get a look at her face. She walked slowly along and turned down\nAir Street and so got through into Regent Street. She walked up</p>",
  "page-1256": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">again\ntowards the Circus. Philip was puzzled. He could not make out what she was\ndoing. Perhaps she was waiting for somebody, and he felt a great curiosity\nto know who it was. She overtook a short man in a bowler hat, who was\nstrolling very slowly in the same direction as herself; she gave him a\nsidelong glance as she passed. She walked a few steps more till she came\nto Swan and Edgar's, then stopped and waited, facing the road. When the\nman came up she smiled. The man stared at her for a moment, turned away\nhis head, and sauntered on. Then Philip understood.</p><p>He was overwhelmed with horror. For a moment he felt such a weakness in\nhis legs that he could hardly stand; then he walked after her quickly; he\ntouched her on the arm.</p><p>\"Mildred.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She turned round with a violent start. He thought that she reddened, but\nin the obscurity he could not see</p>",
  "page-1257": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">very well. For a while they stood and\nlooked at one another without speaking. At last she said:</p><p>\"Fancy seeing you!\"</p><p>He did not know what to answer; he was horribly shaken; and the phrases\nthat chased one another through his brain seemed incredibly melodramatic.</p><p>\"It's awful,\" he gasped, almost to himself.</p><p>She did not say anything more, she turned away from him, and looked down\nat the pavement. He felt that his face was distorted with misery.</p><p>\"Isn't there anywhere we can go and talk?\"</p><p>\"I don't want to talk,\" she said sullenly. \"Leave me alone, can't you?\"</p><p>The thought struck him that perhaps she was in urgent need of money and\ncould not afford to go away at that hour.</p><p>\"I've got a couple of sovereigns on me if you're hard up,\" he blurted out.</p>",
  "page-1258": "<p>\"I don't know what you mean. I was just walking along here on my way back\nto my lodgings.

They walked a few yards and Mildred knocked three times, sharply, at\na door. Philip noticed in the fanlight a cardboard on which was an\nannouncement that apartments were to let. The door was opened quietly, and\nan elderly, tall woman let them in. She gave Philip a stare and then spoke\nto Mildred in an undertone. Mildred led Philip along a passage to a room\nat the back. It was quite dark; she asked him for a match, and lit the\ngas; there was no globe, and the gas flared shrilly. Philip saw that he\nwas in a dingy little bed-room with a suite of furniture, painted to look\nlike pine much too large for it; the lace curtains were very dirty;</p>",
  "page-1260": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\ngrate was hidden by a large paper fan. Mildred sank on the chair which\nstood by the side of the chimney-piece. Philip sat on the edge of the bed.\nHe felt ashamed. He saw now that Mildred's cheeks were thick with rouge,\nher eyebrows were blackened; but she looked thin and ill, and the red on\nher cheeks exaggerated the greenish pallor of her skin. She stared at the\npaper fan in a listless fashion. Philip could not think what to say, and\nhe had a choking in his throat as if he were going to cry. He covered his\neyes with his hands.</p><p>\"My God, it is awful,\" he groaned.</p><p>\"I don't know what you've got to fuss about. I should have thought you'd\nhave been rather pleased.\"</p><p>Philip did not answer, and in a moment she broke into a sob.</p><p>\"You don't think I do it because I like it, do you?\"</p><p>\"Oh, my dear,\" he cried. \"I'm so sorry, I'm so awfully sorry.\"</p>",
  "page-1261": "<p>\"That'll do me a fat lot of good.\"</p><p>Again Philip found nothing to say. He was desperately afraid of saying\nanything which she might take for a reproach or a sneer.</p><p>\"Where's the baby?\" he asked at last.</p><p>\"I've got her with me in London. I hadn't got the money to keep her on at\nBrighton, so I had to take her. I've got a room up Highbury way. I told\nthem I was on the stage. It's a long way to have to come down to the West\nEnd every day, but it's a rare job to find anyone who'll let to ladies at\nall.\"</p><p>\"Wouldn't they take you back at the shop?\"</p><p>\"I couldn't get any work to do anywhere. I walked my legs off looking for\nwork. I did get a job once, but I was off for a week because I was queer,\nand when I went back they said they didn't want me any more. You can't\nblame them either, can you? Them places, they can't afford to have girls\nthat aren't strong.\"</p>",
  "page-1262": "<p>\"You don't look very well now,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"I wasn't fit to come out tonight, but I couldn't help myself, I wanted\nthe money.

I shouldn't have been surprised if you'd just told\nme I'd only got what I deserved.\"</p><p>\"You don't know me very well, do you, even now?\"</p><p>For a moment he remembered all the anguish he had suffered on her account,\nand he was sick with the recollection of his pain. But it was no more than\nrecollection. When he looked at her he knew that he no longer loved her.\nHe was very sorry for her, but he was glad to be free. Watching her\ngravely, he asked himself why he had been so besotted with passion for\nher.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You're a gentleman in every sense of the word,\" she</p>",
  "page-1263": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">said. \"You're the\nonly one I've ever met.\" She paused for a minute and then flushed. \"I hate\nasking you, Philip, but can you spare me anything?\"</p><p>\"It's lucky I've got some money on me. I'm afraid I've only got two\npounds.\"</p><p>He gave her the sovereigns.</p><p>\"I'll pay you back, Philip.\"</p><p>\"Oh, that's all right,\" he smiled. \"You needn't worry.\"</p><p>He had said nothing that he wanted to say. They had talked as if the whole\nthing were natural; and it looked as though she would go now, back to the\nhorror of her life, and he would be able to do nothing to prevent it. She\nhad got up to take the money, and they were both standing.</p><p>\"Am I keeping you?\" she asked. \"I suppose you want to be getting home.\"</p><p>\"No, I'm in no hurry,\" he answered.</p><p>\"I'm glad to have a chance of sitting down.\"</p>",
  "page-1264": "<p>Those words, with all they implied, tore his heart, and it was dreadfully\npainful to see the weary way in which she sank back into the chair. The\nsilence lasted so long that Philip in his embarrassment lit a cigarette.</p><p>\"It's very good of you not to have said anything disagreeable to me,\nPhilip. I thought you might say I didn't know what all.\"</p><p>He saw that she was crying again. He remembered how she had come to him\nwhen Emil Miller had deserted her and how she had wept. The recollection\nof her suffering and of his own humiliation seemed to render more\noverwhelming the compassion he felt now.</p><p>\"If I could only get out of it!\" she moaned. \"I hate it so. I'm unfit for\nthe life, I'm not the sort of girl for that. I'd do anything to get away\nfrom it, I'd be a servant if I could. Oh, I wish I was dead.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And in pity for herself she broke down now completely. She sobbed\nhysterically, and her thin body</p>",

He was tortured by the horror of her\nposition.</p><p>\"Poor child,\" he whispered. \"Poor child.\"</p><p>He was deeply moved. Suddenly he had an inspiration. It filled him with a\nperfect ecstasy of happiness.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Look here, if you want to get away from it, I've got an idea.

If you like you and the baby can come and live there. I pay a woman\nthree and sixpence a week to keep the place clean and to do a little\ncooking for me.

I daresay you can cook\nwell enough for that.\"</p><p>She sprang to her feet and was about to come towards him.</p><p>\"You are good to me, Philip.\"</p><p>\"No, please stop where you are,\" he said hurriedly, putting out his hand\nas though to push her away.</p>",
  "page-1267": "<p>He did not know why it was, but he could not bear the thought that she\nshould touch him.</p><p>\"I don't want to be anything more than a friend to you.\"</p><p>\"You are good to me,\" she repeated. \"You are good to me.\"</p><p>\"Does that mean you'll come?\"</p><p>\"Oh, yes, I'd do anything to get away from this.

It was that in which Cronshaw had died.\nPhilip, though he thought it absurd, had never liked the idea of going\nback to it; and since Cronshaw's death he had remained in the little room,\nsleeping on a fold-up bed, into which he had first moved in order to make\nhis friend comfortable. The baby was sleeping placidly.</p><p>\"You don't recognise her, I expect,\" said Mildred.</p><p>\"I've not seen her since we took her down to Brighton.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Where shall I put her?

She always does.\"</p><p>Mildred put the baby in an arm-chair and looked round the room. She\nrecognised most of the things which she had known in his old diggings.\nOnly one thing was new, a head and shoulders of Philip which Lawson had\npainted at the end of the preceding summer; it hung over the\nchimney-piece; Mildred looked at it critically.</p><p>\"In some ways I like it and in some ways I don't. I think you're better\nlooking than that.\"</p><p>\"Things are looking up,\" laughed Philip. \"You've never told me I was\ngood-looking before.\"</p><p>\"I'm not one to worry myself about a man's looks.

  "page-1272": "<p>Her eyes travelled round the room in an instinctive search for a\nlooking-glass, but there was none; she put up her hand and patted her\nlarge fringe.</p><p>\"What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?\" she asked\nsuddenly.</p><p>\"Oh, there's only a man and his wife living here. He's out all day, and I\nnever see her except on Saturday to pay my rent. They keep entirely to\nthemselves.

Philip\ntried to read, but his spirits were too high: he leaned back in his chair,\nsmoking a cigarette, and with smiling eyes looked at the sleeping child.\nHe felt very happy.

  "page-1273": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">goose-flesh. He could not\nunderstand himself. Presently, knocking at the door, she came in again.</p><p>\"I say, you needn't knock,\" he said. \"Have you made the tour of the\nmansion?\"</p><p>\"It's the smallest kitchen I've ever seen.\"</p><p>\"You'll find it large enough to cook our sumptuous repasts,\" he retorted\nlightly.</p><p>\"I see there's nothing in.

Philip knew\nfrom his experience at the hospital that women of her class looked upon\nservice as degrading: he could not help feeling a little impatient with\nher; but he blamed himself, for it was clear that she was tired and ill.\nHe got up and helped her to lay another place at the table. The baby was\nawake now, and Mildred had prepared some Mellin's Food for it. The liver\nand bacon were ready and they sat down.

He was reading Osler's\nMedicine, which had recently taken the place in the students' favour of\nTaylor's work, for many years the text-book most in use. Presently Mildred\ncame in,</p>",
  "page-1277": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">rolling down her sleeves. Philip gave her a casual glance, but\ndid not move; the occasion was curious, and he felt a little nervous. He\nfeared that Mildred might imagine he was going to make a nuisance of\nhimself, and he did not quite know how without brutality to reassure her.</p><p>\"By the way, I've got a lecture at nine, so I should want breakfast at a\nquarter past eight.

Macalister thought Hayward a</p>",
  "page-1282": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">poor\ncreature, and sneered at his delicacies of sentiment: he asked satirically\nabout Hayward's literary work and received with scornful smiles his vague\nsuggestions of future masterpieces; their arguments were often heated; but\nthe punch was good, and they were both fond of it; towards the end of the\nevening they generally composed their differences and thought each other\ncapital fellows. This evening Philip found them both there, and Lawson\nalso; Lawson came more seldom now that he was beginning to know people in\nLondon and went out to dinner a good deal. They were all on excellent\nterms with themselves, for Macalister had given them a good thing on the\nStock Exchange, and Hayward and Lawson had made fifty pounds apiece. It\nwas a great thing for Lawson, who was extravagant and earned little money:\nhe had arrived at that stage of the portrait-painter's career when he was\nnoticed a good deal by the critics and found a number of aristocratic\nladies who</p>",
  "page-1283": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">were willing to allow him to paint them for nothing (it\nadvertised them both, and gave the great ladies quite an air of\npatronesses of the arts); but he very seldom got hold of the solid\nphilistine who was ready to pay good money for a portrait of his wife.\nLawson was brimming over with satisfaction.</p><p>\"It's the most ripping way of making money that I've ever struck,\" he\ncried. \"I didn't have to put my hand in my pocket for sixpence.\"</p><p>\"You lost something by not being here last Tuesday, young man,\" said\nMacalister to Philip.</p><p>\"My God, why didn't you write to me?\" said Philip. \"If you only knew how\nuseful a hundred pounds would be to me.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Oh, there wasn't time for that.

I made fifty pounds\nfor each of them and a couple of hundred for myself.\"</p><p>Philip was sick with envy. He had recently sold the last mortgage in which\nhis small fortune had been invested and now had only six hundred pounds\nleft. He was panic-stricken sometimes when he thought of the future. He\nhad still to keep himself for two years before he could be qualified, and\nthen he meant to try for hospital appointments, so that he could not\nexpect to earn anything for three years at least. With the most rigid\neconomy he would not have more than a hundred pounds left then.

If he did not catch the last tram he had to\nwalk, and that made him very late. As it was he did not reach home till\nnearly half past twelve. When he got upstairs he was surprised to find\nMildred still sitting in his arm-chair.</p><p>\"Why on earth aren't you in bed?\" he cried.</p><p>\"I wasn't sleepy.\"</p><p>\"You ought to go to bed all the same.

Run off to bed as fast\nas you can, or you won't be able to get up tomorrow morning.\"</p><p>\"I don't feel like going to bed.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense,\" he said coldly.</p><p>She got up, a little sulkily, and went into her room. He smiled when he\nheard her lock the door loudly.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The next few days passed without incident. Mildred settled down in her new\nsurroundings. When Philip hurried off after breakfast she had the whole\nmorning to do the housework. They ate very simply, but she liked to take\na long time to buy the few things they</p>",
  "page-1287": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">needed; she could not be bothered\nto cook anything for her dinner, but made herself some cocoa and ate bread\nand butter; then she took the baby out in the gocart, and when she came in\nspent the rest of the afternoon in idleness. She was tired out, and it\nsuited her to do so little. She made friends with Philip's forbidding\nlandlady over the rent, which he left with Mildred to pay, and within a\nweek was able to tell him more about his neighbours than he had learned in\na year.</p><p>\"She's a very nice woman,\" said Mildred. \"Quite the lady. I told her we\nwas married.\"</p><p>\"D'you think that was necessary?\"</p><p>\"Well, I had to tell her something. It looks so funny me being here and\nnot married to you. I didn't know what she'd think of me.\"</p><p>\"I don't suppose she believed you for a moment.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"That she did, I lay.

In the last two years she had learnt nothing. But he shrugged his\nshoulders.</p><p>\"When all's said and done,\" he reflected, \"she hasn't had much chance.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was a beautiful evening, warm and cloudless, and the people of South\nLondon seemed to have poured out into the streets. There was that\nrestlessness in the air which seizes the cockney sometimes when a turn in\nthe weather calls him into the open. After Mildred had cleared away the\nsupper she went and stood at the</p>",
  "page-1289": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">window. The street noises came up to\nthem, noises of people calling to one another, of the passing traffic, of\na barrel-organ in the distance.</p><p>\"I suppose you must work tonight, Philip?\" she asked him, with a wistful\nexpression.</p><p>\"I ought, but I don't know that I must. Why, d'you want me to do anything\nelse?\"</p><p>\"I'd like to go out for a bit. Couldn't we take a ride on the top of a\ntram?\"</p><p>\"If you like.\"</p><p>\"I'll just go and put on my hat,\" she said joyfully.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The night made it almost impossible to stay indoors. The baby was asleep\nand could be safely left; Mildred said she had always left it alone at\nnight when she went out; it never woke. She was in high spirits when she\ncame back with her hat on. She had taken the opportunity to put on a\nlittle rouge. Philip thought it was excitement which had brought a faint\ncolour to her</p>",
  "page-1290": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">pale cheeks; he was touched by her child-like delight, and\nreproached himself for the austerity with which he had treated her. She\nlaughed when she got out into the air. The first tram they saw was going\ntowards Westminster Bridge and they got on it. Philip smoked his pipe, and\nthey looked at the crowded street. The shops were open, gaily lit, and\npeople were doing their shopping for the next day. They passed a\nmusic-hall called the Canterbury and Mildred cried out:</p><p>\"Oh, Philip, do let's go there. I haven't been to a music-hall for\nmonths.\"</p><p>\"We can't afford stalls, you know.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I don't mind, I shall be quite happy in the gallery.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">They got down and walked back a hundred yards till they came to the doors.\nThey got capital seats for sixpence each, high up but not in the gallery,\nand the night was so fine that there was plenty of room.</p>",
  "page-1291": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Mildred's eyes\nglistened. She enjoyed herself thoroughly. There was a simple-mindedness\nin her which touched Philip.

She was\nextraordinarily unfit for the battle of life. As he watched her now in\nprofile, her mouth slightly open and that delicate flush on her cheeks, he\nthought she looked strangely virginal. He felt an overwhelming compassion\nfor her, and with all his heart he forgave her for the misery she had\ncaused him. The smoky atmosphere made Philip's eyes ache, but when he\nsuggested going she turned to him with beseeching face and asked him to\nstay till the end. He</p>",
  "page-1292": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">smiled and consented. She took his hand and held it\nfor the rest of the performance. When they streamed out with the audience\ninto the crowded street she did not want to go home; they wandered up the\nWestminster Bridge Road, looking at the people.</p><p>\"I've not had such a good time as this for months,\" she said.</p><p>Philip's heart was full, and he was thankful to the fates because he had\ncarried out his sudden impulse to take Mildred and her baby into his flat.\nIt was very pleasant to see her happy gratitude. At last she grew tired\nand they jumped on a tram to go home; it was late now, and when they got\ndown and turned into their own street there was no one about. Mildred\nslipped her arm through his.</p><p>\"It's just like old times, Phil,\" she said.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She had never called him Phil before, that was what Griffiths called him;\nand even now it gave him a curious</p>",
  "page-1293": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">pang. He remembered how much he had\nwanted to die then; his pain had been so great that he had thought quite\nseriously of committing suicide. It all seemed very long ago. He smiled at\nhis past self. Now he felt nothing for Mildred but infinite pity. They\nreached the house, and when they got into the sitting-room Philip lit the\ngas.</p><p>\"Is the baby all right?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I'll just go in and see.\"</p><p>When she came back it was to say that it had not stirred since she left\nit. It was a wonderful child. Philip held out his hand.</p><p>\"Well, good-night.\"</p><p>\"D'you want to go to bed already?\"</p><p>\"It's nearly one. I'm not used to late hours these days,\" said Philip.</p><p>She took his hand and holding it looked into his eyes with a little smile.</p>",
  "page-1294": "<p>\"Phil, the other night in that room, when you asked me to come and stay\nhere, I didn't mean what you thought I meant, when you said you didn't\nwant me to be anything to you except just to cook and that sort of thing.\"</p><p>\"Didn't you?\" answered Philip, withdrawing his hand. \"I did.\"</p><p>\"Don't be such an old silly,\" she laughed.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\"I meant it quite seriously.

Philip spent all day at the hospital\nand worked at home in the evening except when he went to the Athelnys' or\nto the tavern in Beak Street. Once the physician for whom he clerked asked\nhim to a solemn dinner, and two or three times he went to parties given by\nfellow-students. Mildred accepted the monotony of her life. If she minded\nthat Philip left her sometimes by herself in the evening she never\nmentioned it. Occasionally he took her to a music hall. He carried out his\nintention that the only tie between them should be the domestic service\nshe did in return for board and lodging.

He had a naturally\naffectionate disposition, which had had little opportunity to display\nitself. Mildred was not unkind to the little girl. She looked after her\nvery well and once when she had a bad cold proved herself a devoted nurse;\nbut the child bored her, and she spoke to her sharply when she bothered;\nshe was fond of her, but had not the maternal passion which might have\ninduced her to forget herself. Mildred had no demonstrativeness, and she\nfound the manifestations of affection ridiculous. When Philip sat with the\nbaby on his knees, playing with it and kissing it, she laughed at him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You couldn't make more fuss of her if you was her</p>",
  "page-1301": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">father,\" she said.\n\"You're perfectly silly with the child.\"</p><p>Philip flushed, for he hated to be laughed at. It was absurd to be so\ndevoted to another man's baby, and he was a little ashamed of the\noverflowing of his heart. But the child, feeling Philip's attachment,\nwould put her face against his or nestle in his arms.</p><p>\"It's all very fine for you,\" said Mildred. \"You don't have any of the\ndisagreeable part of it.

It was the middle of July. He went one Tuesday\nevening to the tavern in Beak Street and found nobody there but\nMacalister. They sat together, chatting about their absent friends, and\nafter a while Macalister said to him:</p><p>\"Oh, by the way, I heard of a rather good thing today, New Kleinfonteins;\nit's a gold mine in Rhodesia. If you'd like to have a flutter you might\nmake a bit.\"</p>",
  "page-1303": "<p>Philip had been waiting anxiously for such an opportunity, but now that it\ncame he hesitated. He was desperately afraid of losing money.

How much could I lose if\nthings went wrong?\"</p><p>\"I shouldn't have spoken of it, only you seemed so keen about it,\"\nMacalister answered coldly.</p><p>Philip felt that Macalister looked upon him as rather a donkey.</p><p>\"I'm awfully keen on making a bit,\" he laughed.</p><p>\"You can't make money unless you're prepared to risk money.\"</p><p>Macalister began to talk of other things and Philip, while he was\nanswering him, kept thinking that if the venture turned out well the\nstockbroker would be very facetious at his expense next time they met.\nMacalister had a sarcastic tongue.</p>",
  "page-1304": "<p>\"I think I will have a flutter if you don't mind,\" said Philip anxiously.</p><p>\"All right. I'll buy you two hundred and fifty shares and if I see a\nhalf-crown rise I'll sell them at once.\"</p><p>Philip quickly reckoned out how much that would amount to, and his mouth\nwatered; thirty pounds would be a godsend just then, and he thought the\nfates owed him something.

He knew nothing about these things and had difficulty in\nfinding the stock which Macalister had spoken of. He</p>",
  "page-1305": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">saw they had advanced\na quarter. His heart leaped, and then he felt sick with apprehension in\ncase Macalister had forgotten or for some reason had not bought.\nMacalister had promised to telegraph. Philip could not wait to take a tram\nhome. He jumped into a cab. It was an unwonted extravagance.</p><p>\"Is there a telegram for me?\" he said, as he burst in.</p><p>\"No,\" said Mildred.</p><p>His face fell, and in bitter disappointment he sank heavily into a chair.</p><p>\"Then he didn't buy them for me after all.

Lawson and Athelny\ncame to see him, and one day Mrs. Athelny brought two of her children;\nstudents whom he knew looked in now and again to have a chat; Mildred came\ntwice a week.

The landlady called it French cooking, by\nwhich she meant that the poor quality of the materials was disguised by\nill-made sauces: plaice masqueraded as sole and New Zealand mutton as\nlamb. The kitchen was small and inconvenient, so that everything was\nserved up lukewarm. The people were dull and pretentious; old ladies with\nelderly maiden daughters;</p>",

  "page-1321": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the conclusion that it was only obscure to his own\nintelligence. It was the first time that Philip and Mildred had been\nthrown entirely together. In London he did not see her all day, and when\nhe came home the household affairs, the baby, the neighbours, gave them\nsomething to talk about till he settled down to work. Now he spent the\nwhole day with her. After breakfast they went down to the beach; the\nmorning went easily enough with a bathe and a stroll along the front; the\nevening, which they spent on the pier, having put the baby to bed, was\ntolerable, for there was music to listen to and a constant stream of\npeople to look at; (Philip amused himself by imagining who they were and\nweaving little stories about them; he had got into the habit of answering\nMildred's remarks with his mouth only so that his thoughts remained\nundisturbed;) but the afternoons were long and dreary. They sat on the\nbeach. Mildred said they must get all the benefit they</p>",

She had not even the\npower of attending to what she was herself saying, so that a dog running\nin front of her or the passing of a man in a loud blazer would call forth\na remark and then she would forget what she had been speaking of. She had\na bad memory for names, and it irritated her not to be able to think of\nthem, so that she would pause in the middle of some story to rack her\nbrains. Sometimes she had to give it up, but it often</p>",

Her mind was of an order that could not deal for five minutes\nwith the abstract, and when Philip gave way to his taste for generalising\nshe very quickly showed that she was bored. Mildred dreamt a great deal,\nand she had an accurate memory for her dreams, which she would relate\nevery day with prolixity.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One morning he received a long letter from Thorpe Athelny. He was taking\nhis holiday in the theatrical way, in which there was much sound sense,\nwhich characterised him. He had done the same thing for ten</p>",
  "page-1324": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">years. He took\nhis whole family to a hop-field in Kent, not far from Mrs. Athelny's home,\nand they spent three weeks hopping. It kept them in the open air, earned\nthem money, much to Mrs. Athelny's satisfaction, and renewed their contact\nwith mother earth. It was upon this that Athelny laid stress. The sojourn\nin the fields gave them a new strength; it was like a magic ceremony, by\nwhich they renewed their youth and the power of their limbs and the\nsweetness of the spirit: Philip had heard him say many fantastic,\nrhetorical, and picturesque things on the subject. Now Athelny invited him\nto come over for a day, he had certain meditations on Shakespeare and the\nmusical glasses which he desired to impart, and the children were\nclamouring for a sight of Uncle Philip. Philip read the letter again in\nthe afternoon when he was sitting with Mildred on the beach. He thought of\nMrs. Athelny, cheerful mother of many children, with her kindly\nhospitality and her good</p>",
  "page-1325": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">humour; of Sally, grave for her years, with funny\nlittle maternal ways and an air of authority, with her long plait of fair\nhair and her broad forehead; and then in a bunch of all the others, merry,\nboisterous, healthy, and handsome. His heart went out to them. There was\none quality which they had that he did not remember to have noticed in\npeople before, and that was goodness. It had not occurred to him till now,\nbut it was evidently the beauty of their goodness which attracted him. In\ntheory he did not believe in it: if morality were no more than a matter of\nconvenience good and evil had no meaning. He did not like to be illogical,\nbut here was simple goodness, natural and without effort, and he thought\nit beautiful. Meditating, he slowly tore the letter into little pieces; he\ndid not see how he could go without Mildred, and he did not want to go\nwith her.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was very hot, the sky was cloudless, and they had been driven to a\nshady corner. The baby was gravely</p>",
  "page-1326": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">playing with stones on the beach, and\nnow and then she crawled up to Philip and gave him one to hold, then took\nit away again and placed it carefully down. She was playing a mysterious\nand complicated game known only to herself. Mildred was asleep. She lay\nwith her head thrown back and her mouth slightly open; her legs were\nstretched out, and her boots protruded from her petticoats in a grotesque\nfashion. His eyes had been resting on her vaguely, but now he looked at\nher with peculiar attention. He remembered how passionately he had loved\nher, and he wondered why now he was entirely indifferent to her. The\nchange in him filled him with dull pain. It seemed to him that all he had\nsuffered had been sheer waste. The touch of her hand had filled him with\necstasy; he had desired to enter into her soul so that he could share\nevery thought with her and every feeling; he had suffered acutely because,\nwhen silence had fallen between them, a remark of hers showed how</p>",
  "page-1327": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">far\ntheir thoughts had travelled apart, and he had rebelled against the\nunsurmountable wall which seemed to divide every personality from every\nother. He found it strangely tragic that he had loved her so madly and now\nloved her not at all. Sometimes he hated her. She was incapable of\nlearning, and the experience of life had taught her nothing. She was as\nunmannerly as she had always been. It revolted Philip to hear the\ninsolence with which she treated the hard-worked servant at the\nboarding-house.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Presently he considered his own plans. At the end of his fourth year he\nwould be able to take his examination in midwifery, and a year more would\nsee him qualified. Then he might manage a journey to Spain.

His\nheart warmed at the thought of those old beautiful cities, and the tawny\nplains of Castile. He was convinced that more might be got out of life\nthan offered itself at present, and he thought that in Spain he could live\nwith greater intensity: it might be possible to practise in one of those\nold cities, there were a good many foreigners, passing or resident, and he\nshould be able to pick up a living. But that would be much later; first he\nmust get one or two hospital appointments; they gave experience and made\nit easy to get jobs afterwards. He wished to get a berth as ship's doctor\non one of the large tramps that took things leisurely enough for a man to\nsee something of the places at which they stopped. He wanted to go to the\nEast; and his fancy was rich with pictures of Bangkok and Shanghai, and\nthe ports of Japan: he</p>",

The work\nwas a little harder than the corresponding work on the medical side. There\nwas a lecture from nine till ten, when he went into the wards; there\nwounds had to be dressed, stitches taken out, bandages renewed: Philip\nprided himself a little on his skill in bandaging, and it amused him to\nwring a word of approval from a nurse. On certain afternoons in the</p>",

When some\nrare operation was to be performed the theatre would fill up, but\ngenerally there were not more than half a dozen students present, and then\nthe proceedings had a cosiness which Philip enjoyed. At that time the\nworld at large seemed to have a passion for appendicitis, and a good many\ncases came to the operating theatre for this complaint: the surgeon for\nwhom Philip dressed was in friendly rivalry with a colleague as to which\ncould remove an appendix in the shortest time and with the smallest\nincision.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In due course Philip was put on accident duty.

Saturday night was\nof course the busiest time and the closing of the public-houses the\nbusiest hour. Men would be brought in by the police dead drunk and it\nwould be necessary to administer a stomach-pump; women, rather the worse\nfor liquor themselves, would come in with a wound on the head or a\nbleeding nose which their husbands had given them: some would vow to have\nthe law on him, and others, ashamed, would declare that it had been an\naccident.

She liked the work because she was\nher own mistress and had no sister to bother her. Her movements were slow,\nbut she was immensely capable and she never failed in an emergency.

It\ninterested Philip to sit with her in the bare room, with its two\nhorse-hair couches and the flaring gas, and listen to her. She had long\nceased to look upon the people who came in as human beings; they</p>",
  "page-1335": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">were\ndrunks, or broken arms, or cut throats. She took the vice and misery and\ncruelty of the world as a matter of course; she found nothing to praise or\nblame in human actions: she accepted.

  "page-1348": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thought he was a\ngentleman. She was impressed because his father had been a doctor and his\nuncle was a clergyman.

She had hated\nthe life she led. It was horrible to have to be affable and subservient;\nand even now when it crossed her mind she cried with pity for herself as\nshe thought of the roughness of men and their brutal language. But it\ncrossed her mind very seldom. She was grateful to Philip for coming to her\nrescue, and when</p>",
  "page-1349": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">she remembered how honestly he had loved her and how\nbadly she had treated him, she felt a pang of remorse. It was easy to make\nit up to him. It meant very little to her. She was surprised when he\nrefused her suggestion, but she shrugged her shoulders: let him put on\nairs if he liked, she did not care, he would be anxious enough in a little\nwhile, and then it would be her turn to refuse; if he thought it was any\ndeprivation to her he was very much mistaken. She had no doubt of her\npower over him. He was peculiar, but she knew him through and through. He\nhad so often quarrelled with her and sworn he would never see her again,\nand then in a little while he had come on his knees begging to be\nforgiven. It gave her a thrill to think how he had cringed before her. He\nwould have been glad to lie down on the ground for her to walk on him. She\nhad seen him cry. She knew exactly how to treat him, pay no attention to\nhim, just pretend you didn't notice his tempers, leave</p>",
  "page-1350": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">him severely alone,\nand in a little while he was sure to grovel. She laughed a little to\nherself, good-humouredly, when she thought how he had come and eaten dirt\nbefore her. She had had her fling now. She knew what men were and did not\nwant to have anything more to do with them. She was quite ready to settle\ndown with Philip. When all was said, he was a gentleman in every sense of\nthe word, and that was something not to be sneezed at, wasn't it? Anyhow\nshe was in no hurry, and she was not going to take the first step. She was\nglad to see how fond he was growing of the baby, though it tickled her a\ngood deal; it was comic that he should set so much store on another man's\nchild. He was peculiar and no mistake.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But one or two things surprised her.

He wanted to read sometimes and\ntold her to stop talking: she did not know whether to flare up or to sulk,\nand was so puzzled that she did neither. Then came the conversation in\nwhich he told her that he intended their relations to be platonic, and,\nremembering an incident of their common past, it occurred to her that he\ndreaded the possibility of her being pregnant. She took pains to reassure\nhim. It made no difference. She was the sort of woman who was unable to\nrealise that a man might not have her own obsession with sex; her\nrelations with men had been purely on those lines; and she could not\nunderstand that they ever had other interests. The thought struck her that\nPhilip was in love with</p>",

They were associated in his mind with a faint\nodour of iodoform. Philip received no letters, and there was no girl's\nphotograph among his belongings. If he was in love with someone, he was\nvery clever at hiding it; and he answered all Mildred's questions with\nfrankness and apparently without suspicion that there was any motive in\nthem.</p><p>\"I don't believe he's in love with anybody else,\" she said to herself at\nlast.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was a relief, for in that case he was certainly still in love with her;\nbut it made his behaviour very puzzling.</p>",

Her fancy ran riot with bitter misunderstandings,\npurifications by fire, snow-white souls, and death in the cruel cold of a\nChristmas night. She made up her mind that when they went to Brighton she\nwould put an end to all his nonsense; they would be alone there, everyone\nwould think them husband and wife, and there would be the pier and the\nband.

He needn't think she\nwas in love with him, because she wasn't.

She had made out to such of the neighbours as\nshe knew that they were comfortably off: it would be</p>",
  "page-1356": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">a come-down if they\nheard that she had to go out and work. Her natural indolence asserted\nitself. She did not want to leave Philip, and so long as he was willing to\nprovide for her, she did not see why she should. There was no money to\nthrow away, but she got her board and lodging, and he might get better\noff. His uncle was an old man and might die any day, he would come into a\nlittle then, and even as things were, it was better than slaving from\nmorning till night for a few shillings a week. Her efforts relaxed; she\nkept on reading the advertisement columns of the daily paper merely to\nshow that she wanted to do something if anything that was worth her while\npresented itself. But panic seized her, and she was afraid that Philip\nwould grow tired of supporting her. She had no hold over him at all now,\nand she fancied that he only allowed her to stay there because he was fond\nof the baby. She brooded over it all, and she thought to herself angrily\nthat she would make</p>",
  "page-1357": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">him pay for all this some day. She could not reconcile\nherself to the fact that he no longer cared for her. She would make him.\nShe suffered from pique, and sometimes in a curious fashion she desired\nPhilip. He was so cold now that it exasperated her. She thought of him in\nthat way incessantly. She thought that he was treating her very badly, and\nshe did not know what she had done to deserve it. She kept on saying to\nherself that it was unnatural they should live like that. Then she thought\nthat if things were different and she were going to have a baby, he would\nbe sure to marry her. He was funny, but he was a gentleman in every sense\nof the word, no one could deny that. At last it became an obsession with\nher, and she made up her mind to force a change in their relations. He\nnever even kissed her now, and she wanted him to: she remembered how\nardently he had been used to press her lips. It gave her a curious feeling\nto think of it. She often looked at his</p>",

Mildred asked if there were going\nto be women there, but Philip told her there were not; only men had been\ninvited; and they were just going to sit and talk and smoke: Mildred did\nnot think it sounded very amusing; if she were a painter she would have\nhalf a dozen models about. She went to bed, but could not sleep, and\npresently an idea struck her; she got up and fixed the catch on the wicket\nat the landing, so that Philip could not get in.

He had long known that when his fellows were angry with\nhim they never failed to taunt him with his deformity.

There was not much chance that\nany of the students at the hospital would pass along Oxford Street at that\nhour, and he knew hardly anyone else in London; but as Philip worked, with\na huge lump in his throat, he fancied that on turning round he would catch\nthe eye of some man he knew. He made all the haste he could. By the simple\nobservation that all reds went together, and by spacing the costumes more\nthan was usual, Philip got a very good effect; and when the buyer went\ninto the street to look at the result he was obviously pleased.</p>",

The girls in the department noticed\nhis shamefaced way, and they very soon discovered his trick of standing\nwith his back to the street. They laughed at him and called him 'sidey.'</p><p>\"I suppose you're afraid your aunt'll come along and cut you out of her\nwill.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">On the whole he got on well enough with the girls.

One or two\nshowed signs of being willing to start a flirtation with Philip, and he\nwatched their manoeuvres with grave amusement.

He remembered on a sudden all the\ngood talks they had had, and it pained him to think that they would never\ntalk with one another again; he remembered their first meeting and the\npleasant months they had spent together in Heidelberg. Philip's heart sank\nas he thought of the lost years.

There were too many people, provincials with foolish\nfaces, foreigners poring over guide-books; their hideousness besmirched\nthe everlasting masterpieces, their restlessness troubled the god's\nimmortal repose. He went into another room and here there was hardly\nanyone. Philip sat down wearily. His nerves were on edge. He could not get\nthe people out of his mind.

He began to look absently at the tombstones with which the room\nwas lined.

Some\nrepresented a nude figure, seated on a bench, some the departure of the\ndead from those who loved him, and some the dead clasping hands with one\nwho remained behind. On all was the tragic word farewell; that and nothing\nmore. Their simplicity was infinitely touching. Friend parted from friend,\nthe son from his mother, and the restraint made the survivor's grief more\npoignant. It was so long, long ago, and century upon century had passed\nover that unhappiness; for two thousand years those who wept had been dust\nas those they wept for. Yet the woe was alive still, and it filled\nPhilip's heart so that he felt compassion spring up in it, and he said:</p><p>\"Poor things, poor things.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And it came to him that the gaping sight-seers and the fat strangers with\ntheir guide-books, and all those</p>",
  "page-1488": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">mean, common people who thronged the\nshop, with their trivial desires and vulgar cares, were mortal and must\ndie. They too loved and must part from those they loved, the son from his\nmother, the wife from her husband; and perhaps it was more tragic because\ntheir lives were ugly and sordid, and they knew nothing that gave beauty\nto the world. There was one stone which was very beautiful, a bas relief\nof two young men holding each other's hand; and the reticence of line, the\nsimplicity, made one like to think that the sculptor here had been touched\nwith a genuine emotion. It was an exquisite memorial to that than which\nthe world offers but one thing more precious, to a friendship; and as\nPhilip looked at it, he felt the tears come to his eyes. He thought of\nHayward and his eager admiration for him when first they met, and how\ndisillusion had come and then indifference, till nothing held them\ntogether but habit and old memories. It was one of the queer things</p>",
  "page-1489": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of\nlife that you saw a person every day for months and were so intimate with\nhim that you could not imagine existence without him; then separation\ncame, and everything went on in the same way, and the companion who had\nseemed essential proved unnecessary. Your life proceeded and you did not\neven miss him. Philip thought of those early days in Heidelberg when\nHayward, capable of great things, had been full of enthusiasm for the\nfuture, and how, little by little, achieving nothing, he had resigned\nhimself to failure. Now he was dead. His death had been as futile as his\nlife. He died ingloriously, of a stupid disease, failing once more, even\nat the end, to accomplish anything. It was just the same now as if he had\nnever lived.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip asked himself desperately what was the use of living at all. It all\nseemed inane.

The bright hopes of\nyouth had to be paid for at such a bitter price of disillusionment. Pain\nand disease and unhappiness weighed down the scale so heavily. What did it\nall mean?

Other men, with no more advantages than\nhe, succeeded, and others again, with</p>",
  "page-1491": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">many more, failed. It seemed pure\nchance. The rain fell alike upon the just and upon the unjust, and for\nnothing was there a why and a wherefore.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Thinking of Cronshaw, Philip remembered the Persian rug which he had given\nhim, telling him that it offered an answer to his question upon the\nmeaning of life; and suddenly the answer occurred to him: he chuckled: now\nthat he had it, it was like one of the puzzles which you worry over till\nyou are shown the solution and then cannot imagine how it could ever have\nescaped you. The answer was obvious. Life had no meaning. On the earth,\nsatellite of a star speeding through space, living things had arisen under\nthe influence of conditions which were part of the planet's history; and\nas there had been a beginning of life upon it so, under the influence of\nother conditions, there would be an end: man, no more significant than\nother forms of life, had come not as the climax of creation but</p>",
  "page-1492": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">as a\nphysical reaction to the environment. Philip remembered the story of the\nEastern King who, desiring to know the history of man, was brought by a\nsage five hundred volumes; busy with affairs of state, he bade him go and\ncondense it; in twenty years the sage returned and his history now was in\nno more than fifty volumes, but the King, too old then to read so many\nponderous tomes, bade him go and shorten it once more; twenty years passed\nagain and the sage, old and gray, brought a single book in which was the\nknowledge the King had sought; but the King lay on his death-bed, and he\nhad no time to read even that; and then the sage gave him the history of\nman in a single line; it was this: he was born, he suffered, and he died.\nThere was no meaning in life, and man by living served no end. It was\nimmaterial whether he was born or not born, whether he lived or ceased to\nlive. Life was insignificant and death without consequence. Philip\nexulted, as he had</p>",
  "page-1493": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">exulted in his boyhood when the weight of a belief in\nGod was lifted from his shoulders: it seemed to him that the last burden\nof responsibility was taken from him; and for the first time he was\nutterly free. His insignificance was turned to power, and he felt himself\nsuddenly equal with the cruel fate which had seemed to persecute him; for,\nif life was meaningless, the world was robbed of its cruelty. What he did\nor left undone did not matter. Failure was unimportant and success\namounted to nothing. He was the most inconsiderate creature in that\nswarming mass of mankind which for a brief space occupied the surface of\nthe earth; and he was almighty because he had wrenched from chaos the\nsecret of its nothingness. Thoughts came tumbling over one another in\nPhilip's eager fancy, and he took long breaths of joyous satisfaction. He\nfelt inclined to leap and sing. He had not been so happy for months.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Oh, life,\" he cried in his heart, \"Oh life, where is thy</p>",
  "page-1494": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sting?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For the same uprush of fancy which had shown him with all the force of\nmathematical demonstration that life had no meaning, brought with it\nanother idea; and that was why Cronshaw, he imagined, had given him the\nPersian rug. As the weaver elaborated his pattern for no end but the\npleasure of his aesthetic sense, so might a man live his life, or if one\nwas forced to believe that his actions were outside his choosing, so might\na man look at his life, that it made a pattern. There was as little need\nto do this as there was use. It was merely something he did for his own\npleasure. Out of the manifold events of his life, his deeds, his feelings,\nhis thoughts, he might make a design, regular, elaborate, complicated, or\nbeautiful; and though it might be no more than an illusion that he had the\npower of selection, though it might be no more than a fantastic\nlegerdemain in which appearances were interwoven with moonbeams, that</p>",
  "page-1495": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">did\nnot matter: it seemed, and so to him it was. In the vast warp of life (a\nriver arising from no spring and flowing endlessly to no sea), with the\nbackground to his fancies that there was no meaning and that nothing was\nimportant, a man might get a personal satisfaction in selecting the\nvarious strands that worked out the pattern. There was one pattern, the\nmost obvious, perfect, and beautiful, in which a man was born, grew to\nmanhood, married, produced children, toiled for his bread, and died; but\nthere were others, intricate and wonderful, in which happiness did not\nenter and in which success was not attempted; and in them might be\ndiscovered a more troubling grace. Some lives, and Hayward's was among\nthem, the blind indifference of chance cut off while the design was still\nimperfect; and then the solace was comfortable that it did not matter;\nother lives, such as Cronshaw's, offered a pattern which was difficult to\nfollow, the point of view had to be</p>",

His life had\nseemed horrible when it was measured by its happiness, but now he seemed\nto gather strength as he realised that it might be measured by something\nelse. Happiness mattered as little as pain. They came in, both of them, as\nall the other details of his life came in, to the elaboration of the\ndesign. He seemed for an instant to stand above the accidents of his\nexistence, and he felt that they could not affect him again as they had\ndone before. Whatever happened to him now would be one more motive to add\nto the complexity of the pattern, and when the end approached he would\nrejoice in its completion.

Then he\nbegan to speak to his clients of a \"clever young feller, Paris\nart-student, you know,\" who worked for him; and soon Philip, ensconced\nbehind a screen, in his shirt sleeves, was drawing from morning till\nnight. Sometimes he was so busy that he had to dine at three with the\n'stragglers.' He liked it, because there were few of them and they were\nall too tired to talk; the food also was better, for it consisted of what\nwas left over from the buyers' table. Philip's rise from shop-walker to\ndesigner of costumes had a great effect on the department. He realised\nthat he was an object of envy. Harris, the assistant with the</p>",
  "page-1508": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">queer-shaped\nhead, who was the first person he had known at the shop and had attached\nhimself to Philip, could not conceal his bitterness.</p><p>\"Some people 'ave all the luck,\" he said. \"You'll be a buyer yourself one\nof these days, and we shall all be calling you sir.\"</p><p>He told Philip that he should demand higher wages, for notwithstanding the\ndifficult work he was now engaged in, he received no more than the six\nshillings a week with which he started. But it was a ticklish matter to\nask for a rise. The manager had a sardonic way of dealing with such\napplicants.</p><p>\"Think you're worth more, do you? How much d'you think you're worth, eh?\"</p><p>The assistant, with his heart in his mouth, would suggest that he thought\nhe ought to have another two shillings a week.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Oh, very well, if you think you're worth it. You can</p>",
  "page-1509": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">'ave it.\" Then he\npaused and sometimes, with a steely eye, added: \"And you can 'ave your\nnotice too.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was no use then to withdraw your request, you had to go. The manager's\nidea was that assistants who were dissatisfied did not work properly, and\nif they were not worth a rise it was better to sack them at once. The\nresult was that they never asked for one unless they were prepared to\nleave. Philip hesitated. He was a little suspicious of the men in his room\nwho told him that the buyer could not do without him. They were decent\nfellows, but their sense of humour was primitive, and it would have seemed\nfunny to them if they had persuaded Philip to ask for more wages and he\nwere sacked. He could not forget the mortification he had suffered in\nlooking for work, he did not wish to expose himself to that again, and he\nknew there was small chance of his getting elsewhere a post as designer:\nthere were hundreds of people about who could draw as well</p>",
  "page-1510": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">as he. But he\nwanted money very badly; his clothes were worn out, and the heavy carpets\nrotted his socks and boots; he had almost persuaded himself to take the\nventuresome step when one morning, passing up from breakfast in the\nbasement through the passage that led to the manager's office, he saw a\nqueue of men waiting in answer to an advertisement. There were about a\nhundred of them, and whichever was engaged would be offered his keep and\nthe same six shillings a week that Philip had.

Now and then Philip went to the hospital, slinking in\nwhen it was late and there was little chance of meeting anyone he knew, to\nsee whether there were letters for him.

How did his uncle think he was living? He\ndid not even trouble to inquire. He might have starved for all the old man\ncared. But as he walked home something struck him; he stopped under a\nlamp-post and read the letter again; the handwriting had no longer the\nbusiness-like firmness which had characterised it; it was larger and\nwavering: perhaps the illness had shaken him more than he was willing to\nconfess, and he sought in that formal note to express a yearning to see\nthe only relation he had in the world. Philip wrote back that he could\ncome down to Blackstable for a fortnight in July. The invitation was\nconvenient, for he had not known what to do, with his</p>",
  "page-1513": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">brief holiday. The\nAthelnys went hopping in September, but he could not then be spared, since\nduring that month the autumn models were prepared. The rule of Lynn's was\nthat everyone must take a fortnight whether he wanted it or not; and\nduring that time, if he had nowhere to go, the assistant might sleep in\nhis room, but he was not allowed food. A number had no friends within\nreasonable distance of London, and to these the holiday was an awkward\ninterval when they had to provide food out of their small wages and, with\nthe whole day on their hands, had nothing to spend. Philip had not been\nout of London since his visit to Brighton with Mildred, now two years\nbefore, and he longed for fresh air and the silence of the sea. He thought\nof it with such a passionate desire, all through May and June, that, when\nat length the time came for him to go, he was listless.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">On his last evening, when he talked with the buyer</p>",

A hot summer would finish him; Philip\nnoticed how thin his hands were; they trembled. It meant so much to\nPhilip. If he died that summer he could go back to the hospital at the\nbeginning of the winter session; his heart leaped at the thought of\nreturning no more to Lynn's.

He had spent so much on the doctor and so\nmuch more on the chemist, while he was ill they had had to have a fire\nevery day in his bed-room, and now on Sunday he needed a carriage to go to\nchurch in the evening as well as in the morning. Philip felt angrily\ninclined to say he need not be afraid, he was</p>",

He had practised at\nBlackstable for five-and-thirty years. He had the reputation of being very\nsafe, and many of his patients thought it much better that a doctor should\nbe safe than clever. There was a new man at Blackstable—he had been\nsettled there for ten years, but they still looked upon him as an\ninterloper—and he was said to be very clever; but he had not much\npractice among the better people, because no one really knew anything\nabout him.</p>",
  "page-1519": "<p>\"Oh, he's as well as can be expected,\" said Dr. Wigram in answer to\nPhilip's inquiry.</p><p>\"Has he got anything seriously the matter with him?\"</p><p>\"Well, Philip, your uncle is no longer a young man,\" said the doctor with\na cautious little smile, which suggested that after all the Vicar of\nBlackstable was not an old man either.</p><p>\"He seems to think his heart's in a bad way.\"</p><p>\"I'm not satisfied with his heart,\" hazarded the doctor, \"I think he\nshould be careful, very careful.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">On the tip of Philip's tongue was the question: how much longer can he\nlive? He was afraid it would shock. In these matters a periphrase was\ndemanded by the decorum of life, but, as he asked another question\ninstead, it flashed through him that the doctor must be accustomed to the\nimpatience of a sick man's relatives. He must see through their\nsympathetic expressions.</p>",
  "page-1520": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Philip, with a faint smile at his own hypocrisy,\ncast down his eyes.</p><p>\"I suppose he's in no immediate danger?\"</p><p>This was the kind of question the doctor hated.

On the other hand, if you said the patient might live a year\nand he died in a week the family said you did not know your business. They\nthought of all the affection they would have lavished on the defunct if\nthey had known the end was so near. Dr. Wigram made the gesture of washing\nhis hands.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I don't think there's any grave risk so long as he—remains as he is,\" he\nventured at last. \"But on the other hand, we mustn't forget that he's no\nlonger a young man, and well, the machine is wearing out.

  "page-1522": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">else did he say?\" he\nadded suspiciously.</p><p>Philip smiled.</p><p>\"He said that if you take care of yourself there's no reason why you\nshouldn't live to be a hundred.\"</p><p>\"I don't know that I can expect to do that, but I don't see why I\nshouldn't see eighty. My mother lived till she was eighty-four.\"</p><p>There was a little table by the side of Mr. Carey's chair, and on it were\na Bible and the large volume of the Common Prayer from which for so many\nyears he had been accustomed to read to his household. He stretched out\nnow his shaking hand and took his Bible.</p><p>\"Those old patriarchs lived to a jolly good old age, didn't they?\" he\nsaid, with a queer little laugh in which Philip read a sort of timid\nappeal.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The old man clung to life. Yet he believed implicitly all that his\nreligion taught him. He had no doubt in the immortality of the soul, and\nhe felt that he had</p>",
  "page-1523": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">conducted himself well enough, according to his\ncapacities, to make it very likely that he would go to heaven. In his long\ncareer to how many dying persons must he have administered the\nconsolations of religion! Perhaps he was like the doctor who could get no\nbenefit from his own prescriptions. Philip was puzzled and shocked by that\neager cleaving to the earth. He wondered what nameless horror was at the\nback of the old man's mind. He would have liked to probe into his soul so\nthat he might see in its nakedness the dreadful dismay of the unknown\nwhich he suspected.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The fortnight passed quickly and Philip returned to London.

He kept on dreaming the same\ndream: a telegram was handed to him one morning, early, which announced\nthe Vicar's sudden demise, and freedom was in his grasp. When he awoke and\nfound it was nothing but a dream he was filled with sombre rage. He\noccupied himself, now that the event seemed likely to happen at any time,\nwith elaborate plans for the future. In these he passed rapidly over the\nyear which he must spend before it was possible for him to be qualified\nand dwelt on the journey to Spain on which his heart was set. He read\nbooks about that country, which he borrowed from the free library, and\nalready he knew from photographs exactly what each city looked like.

He wrote a prescription, which he said he\nwould leave at the nearest chemist's, and he impressed upon her the\nnecessity of taking her medicine with the utmost regularity. Getting up to\ngo, he held out his hand.</p><p>\"Don't be downhearted, you'll soon get over your throat.\"</p><p>But as he went her face became suddenly distorted, and she caught hold of\nhis coat.</p>",

Philip\nlooked down. Twice that woman had come into his life and made him\nwretched; she had no claim upon him; and yet, he knew not why, deep in his\nheart was a strange aching; it was that which, when he received her\nletter, had left him no peace till he obeyed her summons.</p><p>\"I suppose I shall never really quite get over it,\" he said to himself.</p><p>What perplexed him was that he felt a curious physical distaste, which\nmade it uncomfortable for him to be near her.</p><p>\"What do you want me to do?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Let's go out and dine together.

It seemed to him\nthat he waited an interminable time, and he was on the point of going\naway, thinking his surmise had been mistaken, when the door of No. 7\nopened and Mildred came out. He fell back into the darkness and watched\nher walk towards him. She had on the hat with</p>",
  "page-1546": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a quantity of feathers on it\nwhich he had seen in her room, and she wore a dress he recognized, too\nshowy for the street and unsuitable to the time of year.

He went up to her and touched her on the\narm. He saw that she had rouged her cheeks and painted her lips.</p><p>\"Where are you going, Mildred?\"</p><p>She started at the sound of his voice and reddened as she always did when\nshe was caught in a lie; then the flash of anger which he knew so well\ncame into her eyes as she instinctively sought to defend herself by abuse.\nBut she did not say the words which were on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>\"Oh, I was only going to see the show. It gives me the hump sitting every\nnight by myself.\"</p>",

He received an answer from Mrs.\nFoster, saying that Mr. Carey was not well enough to write himself, but\nwished to see his nephew and would be glad if he came down. She met Philip\nat the door, and when she shook hands with him, said:</p><p>\"You'll find him changed since you was here last, sir; but you'll pretend\nyou don't notice anything, won't you, sir? He's that nervous about\nhimself.\"</p>",
  "page-1550": "<p>Philip nodded, and she led him into the dining-room.</p><p>\"Here's Mr. Philip, sir.\"</p><p>The Vicar of Blackstable was a dying man. There was no mistaking that when\nyou looked at the hollow cheeks and the shrunken body. He sat huddled in\nthe arm-chair, with his head strangely thrown back, and a shawl over his\nshoulders. He could not walk now without the help of sticks, and his hands\ntrembled so that he could only feed himself with difficulty.</p><p>\"He can't last long now,\" thought Philip, as he looked at him.</p><p>\"How d'you think I'm looking?\" asked the Vicar. \"D'you think I've changed\nsince you were here last?\"</p><p>\"I think you look stronger than you did last summer.\"</p><p>\"It was the heat. That always upsets me.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mr. Carey's history of the last few months consisted</p>",
  "page-1551": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in the number of\nweeks he had spent in his bed-room and the number of weeks he had spent\ndownstairs. He had a hand-bell by his side and while he talked he rang it\nfor Mrs. Foster, who sat in the next room ready to attend to his wants, to\nask on what day of the month he had first left his room.</p><p>\"On the seventh of November, sir.\"</p><p>Mr. Carey looked at Philip to see how he took the information.</p><p>\"But I eat well still, don't I, Mrs. Foster?\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir, you've got a wonderful appetite.\"</p><p>\"I don't seem to put on flesh though.\"</p><p>Nothing interested him now but his health. He was set upon one thing\nindomitably and that was living, just living, notwithstanding the monotony\nof his life and the constant pain which allowed him to sleep only when he\nwas under the influence of morphia.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"It's terrible, the amount of money I have to spend</p>",
  "page-1552": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">on doctor's bills.\" He\ntinkled his bell again. \"Mrs. Foster, show Master Philip the chemist's\nbill.\"</p><p>Patiently she took it off the chimney-piece and handed it to Philip.</p><p>\"That's only one month. I was wondering if as you're doctoring yourself\nyou couldn't get me the drugs cheaper. I thought of getting them down from\nthe stores, but then there's the postage.\"</p><p>Though apparently taking so little interest in him that he did not trouble\nto inquire what Phil was doing, he seemed glad to have him there. He asked\nhow long he could stay, and when Philip told him he must leave on Tuesday\nmorning, expressed a wish that the visit might have been longer. He told\nhim minutely all his symptoms and repeated what the doctor had said of\nhim. He broke off to ring his bell, and when Mrs. Foster came in, said:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Oh, I wasn't sure if you were there. I only rang to</p>",
  "page-1553": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">see if you were.\"</p><p>When she had gone he explained to Philip that it made him uneasy if he was\nnot certain that Mrs. Foster was within earshot; she knew exactly what to\ndo with him if anything happened. Philip, seeing that she was tired and\nthat her eyes were heavy from want of sleep, suggested that he was working\nher too hard.</p><p>\"Oh, nonsense,\" said the Vicar, \"she's as strong as a horse.\" And when\nnext she came in to give him his medicine he said to her:</p><p>\"Master Philip says you've got too much to do, Mrs. Foster. You like\nlooking after me, don't you?\"</p><p>\"Oh, I don't mind, sir. I want to do everything I can.\"</p><p>Presently the medicine took effect and Mr. Carey fell asleep. Philip went\ninto the kitchen and asked Mrs. Foster whether she could stand the work.\nHe saw that for some months she had had little peace.</p>",
  "page-1554": "<p>\"Well, sir, what can I do?\" she answered. \"The poor old gentleman's so\ndependent on me, and, although he is troublesome sometimes, you can't help\nliking him, can you? I've been here so many years now, I don't know what\nI shall do when he comes to go.\"</p><p>Philip saw that she was really fond of the old man. She washed and dressed\nhim, gave him his food, and was up half a dozen times in the night; for\nshe slept in the next room to his and whenever he awoke he tinkled his\nlittle bell till she came in. He might die at any moment, but he might\nlive for months. It was wonderful that she should look after a stranger\nwith such patient tenderness, and it was tragic and pitiful that she\nshould be alone in the world to care for him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It seemed to Philip that the religion which his uncle had preached all his\nlife was now of no more than formal importance to him: every Sunday the\ncurate came and administered to him Holy Communion, and</p>",
  "page-1555": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he often read his\nBible; but it was clear that he looked upon death with horror. He believed\nthat it was the gateway to life everlasting, but he did not want to enter\nupon that life. In constant pain, chained to his chair and having given up\nthe hope of ever getting out into the open again, like a child in the\nhands of a woman to whom he paid wages, he clung to the world he knew.</p><p>In Philip's head was a question he could not ask, because he was aware\nthat his uncle would never give any but a conventional answer: he wondered\nwhether at the very end, now that the machine was painfully wearing itself\nout, the clergyman still believed in immortality; perhaps at the bottom of\nhis soul, not allowed to shape itself into words in case it became urgent,\nwas the conviction that there was no God and after this life nothing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">On the evening of Boxing Day Philip sat in the dining-room with his uncle.\nHe had to start very early</p>",
  "page-1556": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">next morning in order to get to the shop by\nnine, and he was to say good-night to Mr. Carey then. The Vicar of\nBlackstable was dozing and Philip, lying on the sofa by the window, let\nhis book fall on his knees and looked idly round the room. He asked\nhimself how much the furniture would fetch. He had walked round the house\nand looked at the things he had known from his childhood; there were a few\npieces of china which might go for a decent price and Philip wondered if\nit would be worth while to take them up to London; but the furniture was\nof the Victorian order, of mahogany, solid and ugly; it would go for\nnothing at an auction. There were three or four thousand books, but\neveryone knew how badly they sold, and it was not probable that they would\nfetch more than a hundred pounds. Philip did not know how much his uncle\nwould leave, and he reckoned out for the hundredth time what was the least\nsum upon which he could finish the curriculum at the</p>",
  "page-1557": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">hospital, take his\ndegree, and live during the time he wished to spend on hospital\nappointments. He looked at the old man, sleeping restlessly: there was no\nhumanity left in that shrivelled face; it was the face of some queer\nanimal. Philip thought how easy it would be to finish that useless life.\nHe had thought it each evening when Mrs. Foster prepared for his uncle the\nmedicine which was to give him an easy night. There were two bottles: one\ncontained a drug which he took regularly, and the other an opiate if the\npain grew unendurable. This was poured out for him and left by his\nbed-side. He generally took it at three or four in the morning. It would\nbe a simple thing to double the dose; he would die in the night, and no\none would suspect anything; for that was how Doctor Wigram expected him to\ndie. The end would be painless. Philip clenched his hands as he thought of\nthe money he wanted so badly. A few more months of that wretched life\ncould</p>",
  "page-1558": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">matter nothing to the old man, but the few more months meant\neverything to him: he was getting to the end of his endurance, and when he\nthought of going back to work in the morning he shuddered with horror. His\nheart beat quickly at the thought which obsessed him, and though he made\nan effort to put it out of his mind he could not. It would be so easy, so\ndesperately easy. He had no feeling for the old man, he had never liked\nhim; he had been selfish all his life, selfish to his wife who adored him,\nindifferent to the boy who had been put in his charge; he was not a cruel\nman, but a stupid, hard man, eaten up with a small sensuality. It would be\neasy, desperately easy. Philip did not dare. He was afraid of remorse; it\nwould be no good having the money if he regretted all his life what he had\ndone. Though he had told himself so often that regret was futile, there\nwere certain things that came back to him occasionally and worried him. He\nwished they were not</p>",
  "page-1559": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">on his conscience.</p><p>His uncle opened his eyes; Philip was glad, for he looked a little more\nhuman then. He was frankly horrified at the idea that had come to him, it\nwas murder that he was meditating; and he wondered if other people had\nsuch thoughts or whether he was abnormal and depraved. He supposed he\ncould not have done it when it came to the point, but there the thought\nwas, constantly recurring: if he held his hand it was from fear. His uncle\nspoke.</p><p>\"You're not looking forward to my death, Philip?\" Philip felt his heart\nbeat against his chest.</p><p>\"Good heavens, no.\"</p><p>\"That's a good boy. I shouldn't like you to do that. You'll get a little\nbit of money when I pass away, but you mustn't look forward to it. It\nwouldn't profit you if you did.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He spoke in a low voice, and there was a curious</p>",
  "page-1560": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">anxiety in his tone. It\nsent a pang into Philip's heart. He wondered what strange insight might\nhave led the old man to surmise what strange desires were in Philip's\nmind.</p><p>\"I hope you'll live for another twenty years,\" he said.</p><p>\"Oh, well, I can't expect to do that, but if I take care of myself I don't\nsee why I shouldn't last another three or four.\"</p><p>He was silent for a while, and Philip found nothing to say. Then, as if he\nhad been thinking it all over, the old man spoke again.</p><p>\"Everyone has the right to live as long as he can.\"</p><p>Philip wanted to distract his mind.</p><p>\"By the way, I suppose you never hear from Miss Wilkinson now?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I had a letter some time this year.

Time was passing, though it went with such\nheavy feet, and he thought that his youth was going and soon he would have\nlost it and nothing would have been accomplished. His work seemed more\naimless now that there was the certainty of his leaving it. He became\nskilful in the designing of costumes, and though he had no</p>",
  "page-1563": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">inventive\nfaculty acquired quickness in the adaptation of French fashions to the\nEnglish market. Sometimes he was not displeased with his drawings, but\nthey always bungled them in the execution. He was amused to notice that he\nsuffered from a lively irritation when his ideas were not adequately\ncarried out. He had to walk warily. Whenever he suggested something\noriginal Mr. Sampson turned it down: their customers did not want anything\noutre, it was a very respectable class of business, and when you had a\nconnection of that sort it wasn't worth while taking liberties with it.\nOnce or twice he spoke sharply to Philip; he thought the young man was\ngetting a bit above himself, because Philip's ideas did not always\ncoincide with his own.</p><p>\"You jolly well take care, my fine young fellow, or one of these days\nyou'll find yourself in the street.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip longed to give him a punch on the nose, but he restrained himself.\nAfter all it could not possibly last</p>",

When at last the news came that the Vicar was dying Philip, who\nhad been thinking of other things, was taken by surprise. It was in July,\nand in another fortnight he was to have gone for his holiday. He received\na letter from Mrs. Foster to say the doctor did not give Mr. Carey many\ndays to live, and if Philip wished to see him again he must come at once.\nPhilip went to the buyer and told him he wanted to leave. Mr. Sampson was\na decent fellow, and when he knew the circumstances made no difficulties.\nPhilip said good-bye to the people in his department; the reason of his\nleaving had spread among them in an exaggerated form, and they thought he\nhad come into a fortune.

He had so anticipated the\nemotions he would experience on this occasion that now he felt nothing: he\nwas as unconcerned as though he were going for a few days' holiday.</p><p>\"I've got a rotten nature,\" he said to himself. \"I look forward to things\nawfully, and then when they come I'm always disappointed.\"</p><p>He reached Blackstable early in the afternoon.

Suddenly\nshe shot a swift glance at Philip.</p><p>\"What did you think of him, Mr. Philip?\"</p><p>She had always refused to call him Uncle Phil as the other children did,\nand would not call him Philip.</p><p>\"I think you'd make an awfully handsome pair.\"</p><p>She looked at him quickly once more, and then with a slight blush went on\nwith her business.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I thought him a very nice civil-spoken young fellow,\" said Mrs. Athelny,\n\"and I think he's just the sort</p>",
  "page-1633": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to make any girl happy.\"</p><p>Sally did not reply for a minute or two, and Philip looked at her\ncuriously: it might be thought that she was meditating upon what her\nmother had said, and on the other hand she might be thinking of the man in\nthe moon.</p><p>\"Why don't you answer when you're spoken to, Sally?\" remarked her mother,\na little irritably.</p><p>\"I thought he was a silly.\"</p><p>\"Aren't you going to have him then?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm not.\"</p><p>\"I don't know how much more you want,\" said Mrs. Athelny, and it was quite\nclear now that she was put out. \"He's a very decent young fellow and he\ncan afford to give you a thorough good home. We've got quite enough to\nfeed here without you. If you get a chance like that it's wicked not to\ntake it. And I daresay you'd be able to have a girl to do the rough work.\"</p>",
  "page-1634": "<p>Philip had never before heard Mrs. Athelny refer so directly to the\ndifficulties of her life.

He knew\nthat the lack made a man petty, mean, grasping; it distorted his character\nand caused him to view the world from a vulgar angle; when you had to\nconsider every penny, money became of grotesque importance: you needed a\ncompetency to rate it at its proper value. He lived a</p>",
  "page-1636": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">solitary life,\nseeing no one except the Athelnys, but he was not lonely; he busied\nhimself with plans for the future, and sometimes he thought of the past.\nHis recollection dwelt now and then on old friends, but he made no effort\nto see them. He would have liked to know what was become of Norah Nesbit;\nshe was Norah something else now, but he could not remember the name of\nthe man she was going to marry; he was glad to have known her: she was a\ngood and a brave soul. One evening about half past eleven he saw Lawson,\nwalking along Piccadilly; he was in evening clothes and might be supposed\nto be coming back from a theatre. Philip gave way to a sudden impulse and\nquickly turned down a side street. He had not seen him for two years and\nfelt that he could not now take up again the interrupted friendship. He\nand Lawson had nothing more to say to one another. Philip was no longer\ninterested in art; it seemed to him that he was</p>",
  "page-1637": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">able to enjoy beauty with\ngreater force than when he was a boy; but art appeared to him unimportant.\nHe was occupied with the forming of a pattern out of the manifold chaos of\nlife, and the materials with which he worked seemed to make preoccupation\nwith pigments and words very trivial. Lawson had served his turn. Philip's\nfriendship with him had been a motive in the design he was elaborating: it\nwas merely sentimental to ignore the fact that the painter was of no\nfurther interest to him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Sometimes Philip thought of Mildred. He avoided deliberately the streets\nin which there was a chance of seeing her; but occasionally some feeling,\nperhaps curiosity, perhaps something deeper which he would not\nacknowledge, made him wander about Piccadilly and Regent Street during the\nhours when she might be expected to be there. He did not know then whether\nhe wished to see her or dreaded it. Once he saw a back</p>",
  "page-1638": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which reminded him\nof hers, and for a moment he thought it was she; it gave him a curious\nsensation: it was a strange sharp pain in his heart, there was fear in it\nand a sickening dismay; and when he hurried on and found that he was\nmistaken he did not know whether it was relief that he experienced or\ndisappointment.</p><p>At the beginning of August Philip passed his surgery, his last\nexamination, and received his diploma. It was seven years since he had\nentered St. Luke's Hospital. He was nearly thirty. He walked down the\nstairs of the Royal College of Surgeons with the roll in his hand which\nqualified him to practice, and his heart beat with satisfaction.</p><p>\"Now I'm really going to begin life,\" he thought.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Next day he went to the secretary's office to put his name down for one of\nthe hospital appointments.

Doctor South. You'd have to go down at\nonce; his assistant has developed mumps. I believe it's a very pleasant\nplace.\"</p><p>There was something in the secretary's manner that puzzled Philip.

  "page-1641": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">got out of the\nstation at Farnley and took a cab to Doctor South's. It was a broad low\nstucco house, with a Virginia creeper growing over it. He was shown into\nthe consulting-room. An old man was writing at a desk. He looked up as the\nmaid ushered Philip in. He did not get up, and he did not speak; he merely\nstared at Philip. Philip was taken aback.</p><p>\"I think you're expecting me,\" he said. \"The secretary of St. Luke's wired\nto you this morning.\"</p><p>\"I kept dinner back for half an hour. D'you want to wash?\"</p><p>\"I do,\" said Philip.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Doctor South amused him by his odd manner. He got up now, and Philip saw\nthat he was a man of middle height, thin, with white hair cut very short\nand a long mouth closed so tightly that he seemed to have no lips at all;\nhe was clean-shaven but for small white whiskers, and they increased the\nsquareness of face which his firm</p>",
  "page-1642": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">jaw gave him. He wore a brown tweed suit\nand a white stock. His clothes hung loosely about him as though they had\nbeen made for a much larger man. He looked like a respectable farmer of\nthe middle of the nineteenth century. He opened the door.</p><p>\"There is the dining-room,\" he said, pointing to the door opposite. \"Your\nbed-room is the first door you come to when you get on the landing. Come\ndownstairs when you're ready.\"</p><p>During dinner Philip knew that Doctor South was examining him, but he\nspoke little, and Philip felt that he did not want to hear his assistant\ntalk.</p><p>\"When were you qualified?\" he asked suddenly.</p><p>\"Yesterday.\"</p><p>\"Were you at a university?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Last year when my assistant took a holiday they sent me a 'Varsity man.\nI told 'em not to do it again. Too</p>",
  "page-1643": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">damned gentlemanly for me.\"</p><p>There was another pause. The dinner was very simple and very good. Philip\npreserved a sedate exterior, but in his heart he was bubbling over with\nexcitement. He was immensely elated at being engaged as a locum; it made\nhim feel extremely grown up; he had an insane desire to laugh at nothing\nin particular; and the more he thought of his professional dignity the\nmore he was inclined to chuckle.</p><p>But Doctor South broke suddenly into his thoughts. \"How old are you?\"</p><p>\"Getting on for thirty.\"</p><p>\"How is it you're only just qualified?\"</p><p>\"I didn't go in for the medical till I was nearly twenty-three, and I had\nto give it up for two years in the middle.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Poverty.\"</p>",
  "page-1644": "<p>Doctor South gave him an odd look and relapsed into silence. At the end of\ndinner he got up from the table.</p><p>\"D'you know what sort of a practice this is?\"</p><p>\"No,\" answered Philip.</p><p>\"Mostly fishermen and their families. I have the Union and the Seamen's\nHospital. I used to be alone here, but since they tried to make this into\na fashionable sea-side resort a man has set up on the cliff, and the\nwell-to-do people go to him. I only have those who can't afford to pay for\na doctor at all.\"</p><p>Philip saw that the rivalry was a sore point with the old man.</p><p>\"You know that I have no experience,\" said Philip.</p><p>\"You none of you know anything.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He walked out of the room without another word and left Philip by himself.\nWhen the maid came in to clear away she told Philip that Doctor South</p>",
  "page-1645": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">saw\npatients from six till seven. Work for that night was over. Philip fetched\na book from his room, lit his pipe, and settled himself down to read. It\nwas a great comfort, since he had read nothing but medical books for the\nlast few months. At ten o'clock Doctor South came in and looked at him.\nPhilip hated not to have his feet up, and he had dragged up a chair for\nthem.</p><p>\"You seem able to make yourself pretty comfortable,\" said Doctor South,\nwith a grimness which would have disturbed Philip if he had not been in\nsuch high spirits.</p><p>Philip's eyes twinkled as he answered.</p><p>\"Have you any objection?\"</p><p>Doctor South gave him a look, but did not reply directly.</p><p>\"What's that you're reading?\"</p><p>\"Peregrine Pickle. Smollett.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I happen to know that Smollett wrote Peregrine</p>",
  "page-1646": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Pickle.\"</p><p>\"I beg your pardon. Medical men aren't much interested in literature, are\nthey?\"</p><p>Philip had put the book down on the table, and Doctor South took it up. It\nwas a volume of an edition which had belonged to the Vicar of Blackstable.\nIt was a thin book bound in faded morocco, with a copperplate engraving as\na frontispiece; the pages were musty with age and stained with mould.\nPhilip, without meaning to, started forward a little as Doctor South took\nthe volume in his hands, and a slight smile came into his eyes. Very\nlittle escaped the old doctor.</p><p>\"Do I amuse you?\" he asked icily.</p><p>\"I see you're fond of books. You can always tell by the way people handle\nthem.\"</p><p>Doctor South put down the novel immediately.</p><p>\"Breakfast at eight-thirty,\" he said and left the room.</p><p>\"What a funny old fellow!\" thought Philip.</p>",
  "page-1647": "<p>He soon discovered why Doctor South's assistants found it difficult to get\non with him. In the first place, he set his face firmly against all the\ndiscoveries of the last thirty years: he had no patience with the drugs\nwhich became modish, were thought to work marvellous cures, and in a few\nyears were discarded; he had stock mixtures which he had brought from St.\nLuke's where he had been a student, and had used all his life; he found\nthem just as efficacious as anything that had come into fashion since.\nPhilip was startled at Doctor South's suspicion of asepsis; he had\naccepted it in deference to universal opinion; but he used the precautions\nwhich Philip had known insisted upon so scrupulously at the hospital with\nthe disdainful tolerance of a man playing at soldiers with children.</p><p>\"I've seen antiseptics come along and sweep everything before them, and\nthen I've seen asepsis take their place. Bunkum!\"</p>",
  "page-1648": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The young men who were sent down to him knew only hospital practice; and\nthey came with the unconcealed scorn for the General Practitioner which\nthey had absorbed in the air at the hospital; but they had seen only the\ncomplicated cases which appeared in the wards; they knew how to treat an\nobscure disease of the suprarenal bodies, but were helpless when consulted\nfor a cold in the head. Their knowledge was theoretical and their\nself-assurance unbounded. Doctor South watched them with tightened lips;\nhe took a savage pleasure in showing them how great was their ignorance\nand how unjustified their conceit. It was a poor practice, of fishing\nfolk, and the doctor made up his own prescriptions. Doctor South asked his\nassistant how he expected to make both ends meet if he gave a fisherman\nwith a stomach-ache a mixture consisting of half a dozen expensive drugs.\nHe complained too that the young medical men were uneducated: their\nreading</p>",

For\ntwo or three days Doctor South watched Philip closely, ready to fall on\nhim with acid sarcasm if he gave him the opportunity; and Philip, aware of\nthis, went about his work with a quiet sense of amusement. He was pleased\nwith the change of occupation. He liked the feeling of independence and of\nresponsibility. All sorts of people came to the consulting-room. He was\ngratified because he seemed able to inspire his patients with confidence;\nand it was entertaining to watch the process of cure which at a hospital\nnecessarily could be watched only at distant intervals. His rounds took\nhim into low-roofed cottages in which were fishing tackle and sails and\nhere and there mementoes of deep-sea travelling, a lacquer box from Japan,\nspears and oars from Melanesia, or daggers from the bazaars of Stamboul;\nthere was an air of romance in</p>",
  "page-1650": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the stuffy little rooms, and the salt of\nthe sea gave them a bitter freshness. Philip liked to talk to the\nsailor-men, and when they found that he was not supercilious they told him\nlong yarns of the distant journeys of their youth.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Once or twice he made a mistake in diagnosis: (he had never seen a case of\nmeasles before, and when he was confronted with the rash took it for an\nobscure disease of the skin;) and once or twice his ideas of treatment\ndiffered from Doctor South's. The first time this happened Doctor South\nattacked him with savage irony; but Philip took it with good humour; he\nhad some gift for repartee, and he made one or two answers which caused\nDoctor South to stop and look at him curiously. Philip's face was grave,\nbut his eyes were twinkling. The old gentleman could not avoid the\nimpression that Philip was chaffing him. He was used to being disliked and\nfeared by his assistants, and this</p>",
  "page-1651": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was a new experience. He had half a\nmind to fly into a passion and pack Philip off by the next train, he had\ndone that before with his assistants; but he had an uneasy feeling that\nPhilip then would simply laugh at him outright; and suddenly he felt\namused. His mouth formed itself into a smile against his will, and he\nturned away. In a little while he grew conscious that Philip was amusing\nhimself systematically at his expense. He was taken aback at first and\nthen diverted.</p><p>\"Damn his impudence,\" he chuckled to himself. \"Damn his impudence.\"</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Down below, by the harbour, the little stone\nhouses of a past century were clustered in a delightful confusion, and the\nnarrow streets, climbing down steeply, had an air of antiquity which\nappealed to the imagination. By the water's edge were neat cottages with\ntrim, tiny gardens in front of them; they were inhabited by retired\ncaptains in the</p>",
  "page-1654": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">merchant service, and by mothers or widows of men who had\ngained their living by the sea; and they had an appearance which was\nquaint and peaceful. In the little harbour came tramps from Spain and the\nLevant, ships of small tonnage; and now and then a windjammer was borne in\nby the winds of romance. It reminded Philip of the dirty little harbour\nwith its colliers at Blackstable, and he thought that there he had first\nacquired the desire, which was now an obsession, for Eastern lands and\nsunlit islands in a tropic sea. But here you felt yourself closer to the\nwide, deep ocean than on the shore of that North Sea which seemed always\ncircumscribed; here you could draw a long breath as you looked out upon\nthe even vastness; and the west wind, the dear soft salt wind of England,\nuplifted the heart and at the same time melted it to tenderness.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One evening, when Philip had reached his last week with Doctor South, a\nchild came to the surgery door</p>",
  "page-1655": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">while the old doctor and Philip were making\nup prescriptions. It was a little ragged girl with a dirty face and bare\nfeet. Philip opened the door.</p><p>\"Please, sir, will you come to Mrs. Fletcher's in Ivy Lane at once?\"</p><p>\"What's the matter with Mrs. Fletcher?\" called out Doctor South in his\nrasping voice.</p><p>The child took no notice of him, but addressed herself again to Philip.</p><p>\"Please, sir, her little boy's had an accident and will you come at once?\"</p><p>\"Tell Mrs. Fletcher I'm coming,\" called out Doctor South.</p><p>The little girl hesitated for a moment, and putting a dirty finger in a\ndirty mouth stood still and looked at Philip.</p><p>\"What's the matter, Kid?\" said Philip, smiling.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Please, sir, Mrs. Fletcher says, will the new doctor</p>",
  "page-1656": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">come?\" There was a\nsound in the dispensary and Doctor South came out into the passage.</p><p>\"Isn't Mrs. Fletcher satisfied with me?\" he barked. \"I've attended Mrs.\nFletcher since she was born. Why aren't I good enough to attend her filthy\nbrat?\"</p><p>The little girl looked for a moment as though she were going to cry, then\nshe thought better of it; she put out her tongue deliberately at Doctor\nSouth, and, before he could recover from his astonishment, bolted off as\nfast as she could run. Philip saw that the old gentleman was annoyed.</p><p>\"You look rather fagged, and it's a goodish way to Ivy Lane,\" he said, by\nway of giving him an excuse not to go himself.</p><p>Doctor South gave a low snarl.</p><p>\"It's a damned sight nearer for a man who's got the use of both legs than\nfor a man who's only got one and a half.\"</p>",
  "page-1657": "<p>Philip reddened and stood silent for a while.</p><p>\"Do you wish me to go or will you go yourself?\" he said at last frigidly.</p><p>\"What's the good of my going?

Doctor South was standing in the dining-room\nwith his back to the fireplace.</p><p>\"You've been a long time,\" he said.</p><p>\"I'm sorry. Why didn't you start dinner?\"</p><p>\"Because I chose to wait. Have you been all this while at Mrs.\nFletcher's?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm afraid I haven't. I stopped to look at the sunset on my way back,\nand I didn't think of the time.\"</p><p>Doctor South did not reply, and the servant brought in some grilled\nsprats.

  "page-1659": "<p>\"Why don't you stay here and I'll get rid of that damned fool with his\nmumps?\"</p><p>\"It's very kind of you, but I hope to get an appointment at the hospital\nin the autumn.

No, my friend. There's no\nsentiment between my patients and me. I don't expect gratitude from them,\nI expect them to pay my fees. Well, what d'you say to it?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Philip made no reply, not because he was thinking over the proposal, but\nbecause he was astonished. It was</p>",
  "page-1660": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">evidently very unusual for someone to\noffer a partnership to a newly qualified man; and he realised with wonder\nthat, although nothing would induce him to say so, Doctor South had taken\na fancy to him. He thought how amused the secretary at St. Luke's would be\nwhen he told him.</p><p>\"The practice brings in about seven hundred a year. We can reckon out how\nmuch your share would be worth, and you can pay me off by degrees. And\nwhen I die you can succeed me.

  "page-1661": "<p>\"I'm awfully sorry, but I can't,\" he said. \"It means giving up everything\nI've aimed at for years. In one way and another I've had a roughish time,\nbut I always had that one hope before me, to get qualified so that I might\ntravel; and now, when I wake in the morning, my bones simply ache to get\noff, I don't mind where particularly, but just away, to places I've never\nbeen to.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now the goal seemed very near. He would have finished his appointment at\nSt. Luke's by the middle of the following year, and then he would go to\nSpain; he could afford to spend several months there, rambling up and down\nthe land which stood to him for romance; after that he would get a ship\nand go to the East. Life was before him and time of no account. He could\nwander, for years if he chose, in unfrequented places, amid strange\npeoples, where life was led in strange ways. He did not know what he\nsought or what his journeys would bring him; but he had a feeling that he\nwould</p>",
  "page-1662": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">learn something new about life and gain some clue to the mystery\nthat he had solved only to find more mysterious. And even if he found\nnothing he would allay the unrest which gnawed at his heart. But Doctor\nSouth was showing him a great kindness, and it seemed ungrateful to refuse\nhis offer for no adequate reason; so in his shy way, trying to appear as\nmatter of fact as possible, he made some attempt to explain why it was so\nimportant to him to carry out the plans he had cherished so passionately.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Doctor South listened quietly, and a gentle look came into his shrewd old\neyes. It seemed to Philip an added kindness that he did not press him to\naccept his offer. Benevolence is often very peremptory. He appeared to\nlook upon Philip's reasons as sound. Dropping the subject, he began to\ntalk of his own youth; he had been in the Royal Navy, and it was his long\nconnection with the sea that, when he retired, had</p>",
  "page-1663": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">made him settle at\nFarnley. He told Philip of old days in the Pacific and of wild adventures\nin China. He had taken part in an expedition against the head-hunters of\nBorneo and had known Samoa when it was still an independent state. He had\ntouched at coral islands. Philip listened to him entranced. Little by\nlittle he told Philip about himself. Doctor South was a widower, his wife\nhad died thirty years before, and his daughter had married a farmer in\nRhodesia; he had quarrelled with him, and she had not come to England for\nten years. It was just as if he had never had wife or child. He was very\nlonely. His gruffness was little more than a protection which he wore to\nhide a complete disillusionment; and to Philip it seemed tragic to see him\njust waiting for death, not impatiently, but rather with loathing for it,\nhating old age and unable to resign himself to its limitations, and yet\nwith the feeling that death was the only solution of the bitterness of his\nlife.

  "page-1664": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his path, and the natural affection which long\nseparation from his daughter had killed—she had taken her husband's part\nin the quarrel and her children he had never seen—settled itself upon\nPhilip. At first it made him angry, he told himself it was a sign of\ndotage; but there was something in Philip that attracted him, and he found\nhimself smiling at him he knew not why. Philip did not bore him. Once or\ntwice he put his hand on his shoulder: it was as near a caress as he had\ngot since his daughter left England so many years before. When the time\ncame for Philip to go Doctor South accompanied him to the station: he\nfound himself unaccountably depressed.</p><p>\"I've had a ripping time here,\" said Philip. \"You've been awfully kind to\nme.\"</p><p>\"I suppose you're very glad to go?\"</p><p>\"I've enjoyed myself here.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"But you want to get out into the world?

Philip thought of the fortnight he was going\nto spend in the hop-field: he was happy at the idea of seeing his friends\nagain, and he rejoiced because the day was fine. But Doctor South walked\nslowly back to his empty house. He felt very old and very lonely.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-1666": "<h3>Cxviii.</h3><p class=\" stretch-last-line start-chapter\">It was late in the evening when Philip arrived at Ferne. It was Mrs.\nAthelny's native village, and she had been accustomed from her childhood\nto pick in the hop-field to which with her husband and her children she\nstill went every year. Like many Kentish folk her family had gone out\nregularly, glad to earn a little money, but especially regarding the\nannual outing, looked forward to for months, as the best of holidays. The\nwork was not hard, it was done in common, in the open air, and for the\nchildren it was a long, delightful picnic; here the young men met the\nmaidens; in the</p>",
  "page-1667": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">long evenings when work was over they wandered about the\nlanes, making love; and the hopping season was generally followed by\nweddings. They went out in carts with bedding, pots and pans, chairs and\ntables; and Ferne while the hopping lasted was deserted. They were very\nexclusive and would have resented the intrusion of foreigners, as they\ncalled the people who came from London; they looked down upon them and\nfeared them too; they were a rough lot, and the respectable country folk\ndid not want to mix with them. In the old days the hoppers slept in barns,\nbut ten years ago a row of huts had been erected at the side of a meadow;\nand the Athelnys, like many others, had the same hut every year.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Athelny met Philip at the station in a cart he had borrowed from the\npublic-house at which he had got a room for Philip. It was a quarter of a\nmile from the hop-field. They left his bag there and walked over to the\nmeadow in which were the huts. They were nothing</p>",
  "page-1668": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">more than a long, low\nshed, divided into little rooms about twelve feet square. In front of each\nwas a fire of sticks, round which a family was grouped, eagerly watching\nthe cooking of supper. The sea-air and the sun had browned already the\nfaces of Athelny's children. Mrs. Athelny seemed a different woman in her\nsun-bonnet: you felt that the long years in the city had made no real\ndifference to her; she was the country woman born and bred, and you could\nsee how much at home she found herself in the country. She was frying\nbacon and at the same time keeping an eye on the younger children, but she\nhad a hearty handshake and a jolly smile for Philip. Athelny was\nenthusiastic over the delights of a rural existence.</p><p>\"We're starved for sun and light in the cities we live in. It isn't life,\nit's a long imprisonment. Let us sell all we have, Betty, and take a farm\nin the country.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I can see you in the country,\" she answered with</p>",
  "page-1669": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">good-humoured scorn.\n\"Why, the first rainy day we had in the winter you'd be crying for\nLondon.\" She turned to Philip. \"Athelny's always like this when we come\ndown here. Country, I like that! Why, he don't know a swede from a\nmangel-wurzel.\"</p><p>\"Daddy was lazy today,\" remarked Jane, with the frankness which\ncharacterized her, \"he didn't fill one bin.\"</p><p>\"I'm getting into practice, child, and tomorrow I shall fill more bins\nthan all of you put together.\"</p><p>\"Come and eat your supper, children,\" said Mrs. Athelny. \"Where's Sally?\"</p><p>\"Here I am, mother.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She stepped out of their little hut, and the flames of the wood fire\nleaped up and cast sharp colour upon her face. Of late Philip had only\nseen her in the trim frocks she had taken to since she was at the\ndressmaker's, and there was something very charming in the print dress</p>",
  "page-1670": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">she\nwore now, loose and easy to work in; the sleeves were tucked up and showed\nher strong, round arms. She too had a sun-bonnet.</p><p>\"You look like a milkmaid in a fairy story,\" said Philip, as he shook\nhands with her.</p><p>\"She's the belle of the hop-fields,\" said Athelny. \"My word, if the\nSquire's son sees you he'll make you an offer of marriage before you can\nsay Jack Robinson.\"</p><p>\"The Squire hasn't got a son, father,\" said Sally.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She looked about for a place to sit down in, and Philip made room for her\nbeside him. She looked wonderful in the night lit by wood fires. She was\nlike some rural goddess, and you thought of those fresh, strong girls whom\nold Herrick had praised in exquisite numbers. The supper was simple, bread\nand butter, crisp bacon, tea for the children, and beer for Mr. and Mrs.\nAthelny and Philip. Athelny, eating hungrily, praised loudly all he ate.\nHe flung words of scorn at</p>",
  "page-1671": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Lucullus and piled invectives upon\nBrillat-Savarin.</p><p>\"There's one thing one can say for you, Athelny,\" said his wife, \"you do\nenjoy your food and no mistake!\"</p><p>\"Cooked by your hand, my Betty,\" he said, stretching out an eloquent\nforefinger.</p><p>Philip felt himself very comfortable. He looked happily at the line of\nfires, with people grouped about them, and the colour of the flames\nagainst the night; at the end of the meadow was a line of great elms, and\nabove the starry sky. The children talked and laughed, and Athelny, a\nchild among them, made them roar by his tricks and fancies.</p><p>\"They think a rare lot of Athelny down here,\" said his wife. \"Why, Mrs.\nBridges said to me, I don't know what we should do without Mr. Athelny\nnow, she said. He's always up to something, he's more like a schoolboy\nthan the father of a family.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Sally sat in silence, but she attended to Philip's wants</p>",
  "page-1672": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in a thoughtful\nfashion that charmed him. It was pleasant to have her beside him, and now\nand then he glanced at her sunburned, healthy face. Once he caught her\neyes, and she smiled quietly. When supper was over Jane and a small\nbrother were sent down to a brook that ran at the bottom of the meadow to\nfetch a pail of water for washing up.</p><p>\"You children, show your Uncle Philip where we sleep, and then you must be\nthinking of going to bed.\"</p><p>Small hands seized Philip, and he was dragged towards the hut. He went in\nand struck a match. There was no furniture in it; and beside a tin box, in\nwhich clothes were kept, there was nothing but the beds; there were three\nof them, one against each wall. Athelny followed Philip in and showed them\nproudly.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"That's the stuff to sleep on,\" he cried. \"None of your spring-mattresses\nand swansdown. I never sleep so soundly anywhere as here. YOU will\nsleep between</p>",
  "page-1673": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sheets. My dear fellow, I pity you from the bottom of my\nsoul.\"</p><p>The beds consisted of a thick layer of hopvine, on the top of which was a\ncoating of straw, and this was covered with a blanket. After a day in the\nopen air, with the aromatic scent of the hops all round them, the happy\npickers slept like tops. By nine o'clock all was quiet in the meadow and\neveryone in bed but one or two men who still lingered in the public-house\nand would not come back till it was closed at ten. Athelny walked there\nwith Philip. But before he went Mrs. Athelny said to him:</p><p>\"We breakfast about a quarter to six, but I daresay you won't want to get\nup as early as that. You see, we have to set to work at six.\"</p><p>\"Of course he must get up early,\" cried Athelny, \"and he must work like\nthe rest of us. He's got to earn his board. No work, no dinner, my lad.\"</p>",
  "page-1674": "<p>\"The children go down to bathe before breakfast, and they can give you a\ncall on their way back. They pass The Jolly Sailor.\"</p><p>\"If they'll wake me I'll come and bathe with them,\" said Philip.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Jane and Harold and Edward shouted with delight at the prospect, and next\nmorning Philip was awakened out of a sound sleep by their bursting into\nhis room. The boys jumped on his bed, and he had to chase them out with\nhis slippers. He put on a coat and a pair of trousers and went down. The\nday had only just broken, and there was a nip in the air; but the sky was\ncloudless, and the sun was shining yellow. Sally, holding Connie's hand,\nwas standing in the middle of the road, with a towel and a bathing-dress\nover her arm. He saw now that her sun-bonnet was of the colour of\nlavender, and against it her face, red and brown, was like an apple. She\ngreeted him with her slow, sweet smile, and he noticed</p>",
  "page-1675": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">suddenly that her\nteeth were small and regular and very white. He wondered why they had\nnever caught his attention before.</p><p>\"I was for letting you sleep on,\" she said, \"but they would go up and wake\nyou. I said you didn't really want to come.\"</p><p>\"Oh, yes, I did.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">They walked down the road and then cut across the marshes. That way it was\nunder a mile to the sea. The water looked cold and gray, and Philip\nshivered at the sight of it; but the others tore off their clothes and ran\nin shouting. Sally did everything a little slowly, and she did not come\ninto the water till all the rest were splashing round Philip. Swimming was\nhis only accomplishment; he felt at home in the water; and soon he had\nthem all imitating him as he played at being a porpoise, and a drowning\nman, and a fat lady afraid of wetting her hair. The bathe was uproarious,\nand it was</p>",
  "page-1676": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">necessary for Sally to be very severe to induce them all to\ncome out.</p><p>\"You're as bad as any of them,\" she said to Philip, in her grave, maternal\nway, which was at once comic and touching. \"They're not anything like so\nnaughty when you're not here.\"</p><p>They walked back, Sally with her bright hair streaming over one shoulder\nand her sun-bonnet in her hand, but when they got to the huts Mrs. Athelny\nhad already started for the hop-garden. Athleny, in a pair of the oldest\ntrousers anyone had ever worn, his jacket buttoned up to show he had no\nshirt on, and in a wide-brimmed soft hat, was frying kippers over a fire\nof sticks. He was delighted with himself: he looked every inch a brigand.\nAs soon as he saw the party he began to shout the witches' chorus from\nMacbeth over the odorous kippers.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You mustn't dawdle over your breakfast or mother</p>",
  "page-1677": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">will be angry,\" he said,\nwhen they came up.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And in a few minutes, Harold and Jane with pieces of bread and butter in\ntheir hands, they sauntered through the meadow into the hop-field. They\nwere the last to leave. A hop-garden was one of the sights connected with\nPhilip's boyhood and the oast-houses to him the most typical feature of\nthe Kentish scene. It was with no sense of strangeness, but as though he\nwere at home, that Philip followed Sally through the long lines of the\nhops. The sun was bright now and cast a sharp shadow. Philip feasted his\neyes on the richness of the green leaves. The hops were yellowing, and to\nhim they had the beauty and the passion which poets in Sicily have found\nin the purple grape. As they walked along Philip felt himself overwhelmed\nby the rich luxuriance. A sweet scent arose from the fat Kentish soil, and\nthe fitful September breeze was heavy with the goodly perfume of the hops.\nAthelstan felt the exhilaration</p>",
  "page-1678": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">instinctively, for he lifted up his voice\nand sang; it was the cracked voice of the boy of fifteen, and Sally turned\nround.</p><p>\"You be quiet, Athelstan, or we shall have a thunderstorm.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In a moment they heard the hum of voices, and in a moment more came upon\nthe pickers. They were all hard at work, talking and laughing as they\npicked. They sat on chairs, on stools, on boxes, with their baskets by\ntheir sides, and some stood by the bin throwing the hops they picked\nstraight into it. There were a lot of children about and a good many\nbabies, some in makeshift cradles, some tucked up in a rug on the soft\nbrown dry earth. The children picked a little and played a great deal. The\nwomen worked busily, they had been pickers from childhood, and they could\npick twice as fast as foreigners from London. They boasted about the\nnumber of bushels they had picked in a day, but they</p>",
  "page-1679": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">complained you could\nnot make money now as in former times: then they paid you a shilling for\nfive bushels, but now the rate was eight and even nine bushels to the\nshilling. In the old days a good picker could earn enough in the season to\nkeep her for the rest of the year, but now there was nothing in it; you\ngot a holiday for nothing, and that was about all. Mrs. Hill had bought\nherself a pianner out of what she made picking, so she said, but she was\nvery near, one wouldn't like to be near like that, and most people thought\nit was only what she said, if the truth was known perhaps it would be\nfound that she had put a bit of money from the savings bank towards it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The hoppers were divided into bin companies of ten pickers, not counting\nchildren, and Athelny loudly boasted of the day when he would have a\ncompany consisting entirely of his own family. Each company had a bin-man,\nwhose duty it was to supply it with strings of</p>",
  "page-1680": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">hops at their bins (the bin\nwas a large sack on a wooden frame, about seven feet high, and long rows\nof them were placed between the rows of hops;) and it was to this position\nthat Athelny aspired when his family was old enough to form a company.\nMeanwhile he worked rather by encouraging others than by exertions of his\nown. He sauntered up to Mrs. Athelny, who had been busy for half an hour\nand had already emptied a basket into the bin, and with his cigarette\nbetween his lips began to pick. He asserted that he was going to pick more\nthan anyone that day, but mother; of course no one could pick so much as\nmother; that reminded him of the trials which Aphrodite put upon the\ncurious Psyche, and he began to tell his children the story of her love\nfor the unseen bridegroom. He told it very well. It seemed to Philip,\nlistening with a smile on his lips, that the old tale fitted in with the\nscene. The sky was very blue now, and he thought it could not be more\nlovely</p>",
  "page-1681": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">even in Greece. The children with their fair hair and rosy cheeks,\nstrong, healthy, and vivacious; the delicate form of the hops; the\nchallenging emerald of the leaves, like a blare of trumpets; the magic of\nthe green alley, narrowing to a point as you looked down the row, with the\npickers in their sun-bonnets: perhaps there was more of the Greek spirit\nthere than you could find in the books of professors or in museums. He was\nthankful for the beauty of England. He thought of the winding white roads\nand the hedgerows, the green meadows with their elm-trees, the delicate\nline of the hills and the copses that crowned them, the flatness of the\nmarshes, and the melancholy of the North Sea. He was very glad that he\nfelt its loveliness. But presently Athelny grew restless and announced\nthat he would go and ask how Robert Kemp's mother was. He knew everyone in\nthe garden and called them all by their Christian names; he knew their\nfamily histories and all</p>",
  "page-1682": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that had happened to them from birth. With\nharmless vanity he played the fine gentleman among them, and there was a\ntouch of condescension in his familiarity. Philip would not go with him.</p><p>\"I'm going to earn my dinner,\" he said.</p><p>\"Quite right, my boy,\" answered Athelny, with a wave of the hand, as he\nstrolled away. \"No work, no dinner.\"</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-1683": "<h3>Cxix.</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">Philip had not a basket of his own, but sat with Sally. Jane thought it\nmonstrous that he should help her elder sister rather than herself, and he\nhad to promise to pick for her when Sally's basket was full. Sally was\nalmost as quick as her mother.</p><p>\"Won't it hurt your hands for sewing?\" asked Philip.</p><p>\"Oh, no, it wants soft hands. That's why women pick better than men. If\nyour hands are hard and your fingers all stiff with a lot of rough work\nyou can't pick near so well.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He liked to see her deft movements, and she watched</p>",
  "page-1684": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">him too now and then\nwith that maternal spirit of hers which was so amusing and yet so\ncharming. He was clumsy at first, and she laughed at him. When she bent\nover and showed him how best to deal with a whole line their hands met. He\nwas surprised to see her blush. He could not persuade himself that she was\na woman; because he had known her as a flapper, he could not help looking\nupon her as a child still; yet the number of her admirers showed that she\nwas a child no longer; and though they had only been down a few days one\nof Sally's cousins was already so attentive that she had to endure a lot\nof chaffing. His name was Peter Gann, and he was the son of Mrs. Athelny's\nsister, who had married a farmer near Ferne. Everyone knew why he found it\nnecessary to walk through the hop-field every day.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A call-off by the sounding of a horn was made for breakfast at eight, and\nthough Mrs. Athelny told them</p>",
  "page-1685": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">they had not deserved it, they ate it very\nheartily. They set to work again and worked till twelve, when the horn\nsounded once more for dinner. At intervals the measurer went his round\nfrom bin to bin, accompanied by the booker, who entered first in his own\nbook and then in the hopper's the number of bushels picked. As each bin\nwas filled it was measured out in bushel baskets into a huge bag called a\npoke; and this the measurer and the pole-puller carried off between them\nand put on the waggon. Athelny came back now and then with stories of how\nmuch Mrs. Heath or Mrs. Jones had picked, and he conjured his family to\nbeat her: he was always wanting to make records, and sometimes in his\nenthusiasm picked steadily for an hour. His chief amusement in it,\nhowever, was that it showed the beauty of his graceful hands, of which he\nwas excessively proud. He spent much time manicuring them. He told Philip,\nas he stretched out his tapering</p>",
  "page-1686": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">fingers, that the Spanish grandees had\nalways slept in oiled gloves to preserve their whiteness. The hand that\nwrung the throat of Europe, he remarked dramatically, was as shapely and\nexquisite as a woman's; and he looked at his own, as he delicately picked\nthe hops, and sighed with self-satisfaction. When he grew tired of this he\nrolled himself a cigarette and discoursed to Philip of art and literature.\nIn the afternoon it grew very hot. Work did not proceed so actively and\nconversation halted. The incessant chatter of the morning dwindled now to\ndesultory remarks. Tiny beads of sweat stood on Sally's upper lip, and as\nshe worked her lips were slightly parted. She was like a rosebud bursting\ninto flower.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Calling-off time depended on the state of the oast-house. Sometimes it was\nfilled early, and as many hops had been picked by three or four as could\nbe dried during the night. Then work was stopped. But generally the last\nmeasuring of the day began at five. As each</p>",
  "page-1687": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">company had its bin measured\nit gathered up its things and, chatting again now that work was over,\nsauntered out of the garden. The women went back to the huts to clean up\nand prepare the supper, while a good many of the men strolled down the\nroad to the public-house. A glass of beer was very pleasant after the\nday's work.</p><p>The Athelnys' bin was the last to be dealt with. When the measurer came\nMrs. Athelny, with a sigh of relief, stood up and stretched her arms: she\nhad been sitting in the same position for many hours and was stiff.</p><p>\"Now, let's go to The Jolly Sailor,\" said Athelny. \"The rites of the day\nmust be duly performed, and there is none more sacred than that.\"</p><p>\"Take a jug with you, Athelny,\" said his wife, \"and bring back a pint and\na half for supper.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She gave him the money, copper by copper. The bar-parlour was already well\nfilled. It had a sanded floor,</p>",
  "page-1688": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">benches round it, and yellow pictures of\nVictorian prize-fighters on the walls. The licencee knew all his customers\nby name, and he leaned over his bar smiling benignly at two young men who\nwere throwing rings on a stick that stood up from the floor: their failure\nwas greeted with a good deal of hearty chaff from the rest of the company.\nRoom was made for the new arrivals. Philip found himself sitting between\nan old labourer in corduroys, with string tied under his knees, and a\nshiny-faced lad of seventeen with a love-lock neatly plastered on his red\nforehead. Athelny insisted on trying his hand at the throwing of rings. He\nbacked himself for half a pint and won it. As he drank the loser's health\nhe said:</p><p>\"I would sooner have won this than won the Derby, my boy.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He was an outlandish figure, with his wide-brimmed hat and pointed beard,\namong those country folk, and it was easy to see that they thought him\nvery</p>",
  "page-1689": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">queer; but his spirits were so high, his enthusiasm so contagious,\nthat it was impossible not to like him. Conversation went easily. A\ncertain number of pleasantries were exchanged in the broad, slow accent of\nthe Isle of Thanet, and there was uproarious laughter at the sallies of\nthe local wag. A pleasant gathering! It would have been a hard-hearted\nperson who did not feel a glow of satisfaction in his fellows. Philip's\neyes wandered out of the window where it was bright and sunny still; there\nwere little white curtains in it tied up with red ribbon like those of a\ncottage window, and on the sill were pots of geraniums. In due course one\nby one the idlers got up and sauntered back to the meadow where supper was\ncooking.</p><p>\"I expect you'll be ready for your bed,\" said Mrs. Athelny to Philip.\n\"You're not used to getting up at five and staying in the open air all\nday.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You're coming to bathe with us, Uncle Phil, aren't</p>",
  "page-1690": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">you?\" the boys cried.</p><p>\"Rather.\"</p><p>He was tired and happy. After supper, balancing himself against the wall\nof the hut on a chair without a back, he smoked his pipe and looked at the\nnight. Sally was busy. She passed in and out of the hut, and he lazily\nwatched her methodical actions. Her walk attracted his notice; it was not\nparticularly graceful, but it was easy and assured; she swung her legs\nfrom the hips, and her feet seemed to tread the earth with decision.\nAthelny had gone off to gossip with one of the neighbours, and presently\nPhilip heard his wife address the world in general.</p><p>\"There now, I'm out of tea and I wanted Athelny to go down to Mrs. Black's\nand get some.\" A pause, and then her voice was raised: \"Sally, just run\ndown to Mrs. Black's and get me half a pound of tea, will you? I've run\nquite out of it.\"</p>",
  "page-1691": "<p>\"All right, mother.\"</p><p>Mrs. Black had a cottage about half a mile along the road, and she\ncombined the office of postmistress with that of universal provider. Sally\ncame out of the hut, turning down her sleeves.</p><p>\"Shall I come with you, Sally?\" asked Philip.</p><p>\"Don't you trouble. I'm not afraid to go alone.\"</p><p>\"I didn't think you were; but it's getting near my bedtime, and I was just\nthinking I'd like to stretch my legs.\"</p><p>Sally did not answer, and they set out together. The road was white and\nsilent. There was not a sound in the summer night. They did not speak\nmuch.</p><p>\"It's quite hot even now, isn't it?\" said Philip.</p><p>\"I think it's wonderful for the time of year.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But their silence did not seem awkward. They found it was pleasant to walk\nside by side and felt no need of words. Suddenly at a stile in the\nhedgerow they heard a</p>",
  "page-1692": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">low murmur of voices, and in the darkness they saw\nthe outline of two people. They were sitting very close to one another and\ndid not move as Philip and Sally passed.</p><p>\"I wonder who that was,\" said Sally.</p><p>\"They looked happy enough, didn't they?\"</p><p>\"I expect they took us for lovers too.\"</p><p>They saw the light of the cottage in front of them, and in a minute went\ninto the little shop. The glare dazzled them for a moment.</p><p>\"You are late,\" said Mrs. Black. \"I was just going to shut up.\" She looked\nat the clock. \"Getting on for nine.\"</p><p>Sally asked for her half pound of tea (Mrs. Athelny could never bring\nherself to buy more than half a pound at a time), and they set off up the\nroad again. Now and then some beast of the night made a short, sharp\nsound, but it seemed only to make the silence more marked.</p>",
  "page-1693": "<p>\"I believe if you stood still you could hear the sea,\" said Sally.</p><p>They strained their ears, and their fancy presented them with a faint\nsound of little waves lapping up against the shingle.

The earth gave forth its freshness. There was something\nstrange in the tremulous night, and something, you knew not what, seemed\nto be waiting; the silence was on a sudden pregnant with meaning. Philip\nhad a queer feeling in his heart, it seemed very full, it seemed to melt\n(the hackneyed phrases expressed precisely the curious sensation), he felt\nhappy and anxious and expectant. To</p>",
  "page-1694": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his memory came back those lines in\nwhich Jessica and Lorenzo murmur melodious words to one another, capping\neach other's utterance; but passion shines bright and clear through the\nconceits that amuse them. He did not know what there was in the air that\nmade his senses so strangely alert; it seemed to him that he was pure soul\nto enjoy the scents and the sounds and the savours of the earth. He had\nnever felt such an exquisite capacity for beauty. He was afraid that Sally\nby speaking would break the spell, but she said never a word, and he\nwanted to hear the sound of her voice. Its low richness was the voice of\nthe country night itself.</p><p>They arrived at the field through which she had to walk to get back to the\nhuts. Philip went in to hold the gate open for her.</p><p>\"Well, here I think I'll say good-night.\"</p><p>\"Thank you for coming all that way with me.\"</p><p>She gave him her hand, and as he took it, he said:</p>",
  "page-1695": "<p>\"If you were very nice you'd kiss me good-night like the rest of the\nfamily.\"</p><p>\"I don't mind,\" she said.</p><p>Philip had spoken in jest.

He had expected the incident of the night before to have\ncaused some revolution in her, but it was just as though nothing had\nhappened; it might have been a dream; and as he walked along, a little\ngirl holding on to one hand and a little boy to the other, while he\nchatted as unconcernedly as he could, he sought for an explanation. He\nwondered whether Sally meant the affair to be forgotten. Perhaps her\nsenses had run away with her just as his had, and, treating what had\noccurred as an accident due to unusual circumstances, it might be that she\nhad decided to put the matter out of her mind. It was ascribing to her a\npower of thought and a mature wisdom which fitted neither with her age nor\nwith her character. But he realised that he knew nothing of her.

Presently she went out and began drying\nherself; she called to the others more or less peremptorily, and at last\nonly Philip was left in the water. He took the opportunity to have a good\nhard swim. He was more used to the cold water this second morning, and he\nrevelled in its salt freshness; it rejoiced him to use his limbs freely,\nand he covered the water with long, firm strokes. But Sally, with a towel\nround her, went down to the water's edge.</p><p>\"You're to come out this minute, Philip,\" she called, as though he were a\nsmall boy under her charge.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And when, smiling with amusement at her</p>",

When\nthey were all sitting again in the hop-field she told her mother how\nnaughty Philip had been in not coming out of the water till he was blue\nwith cold.

It was a great affection that he felt\nfor her, and he liked her company; it was curiously soothing; and he had\na feeling for her which seemed to him ridiculous to entertain towards a\nshop-girl of nineteen: he respected her. And he admired her magnificent\nhealthiness. She was a splendid animal, without defect; and physical\nperfection filled him always with admiring awe. She made him feel\nunworthy.</p><p>Then, one day, about three weeks after they had come back to London as\nthey walked together, he noticed that she was unusually silent.

How could he have got into such a mess? But at the same\ntime, for his thoughts chased one another through his brain and yet seemed\nto stand together, in a hopeless confusion, like the pieces of a jig-saw\npuzzle seen in a nightmare, he asked himself what he was going to do.\nEverything was so clear before him, all he had aimed at so long within\nreach at last, and now his inconceivable stupidity had erected this new\nobstacle. Philip had never been able to surmount what he acknowledged was\na defect in his resolute desire for a well ordered life, and that was his\npassion for living in the future; and no sooner was he settled in his work\nat the hospital than he had busied himself with arrangements for his\ntravels. In the past he had often tried not to think too circumstantially\nof his plans for</p>",
  "page-1714": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the future, it was only discouraging; but now that his\ngoal was so near he saw no harm in giving away to a longing that was so\ndifficult to resist. First of all he meant to go to Spain. That was the\nland of his heart; and by now he was imbued with its spirit, its romance\nand colour and history and grandeur; he felt that it had a message for him\nin particular which no other country could give. He knew the fine old\ncities already as though he had trodden their tortuous streets from\nchildhood. Cordova, Seville, Toledo, Leon, Tarragona, Burgos. The great\npainters of Spain were the painters of his soul, and his pulse beat\nquickly as he pictured his ecstasy on standing face to face with those\nworks which were more significant than any others to his own tortured,\nrestless heart. He had read the great poets, more characteristic of their\nrace than the poets of other lands; for they seemed to have drawn their\ninspiration not at all from the general currents of the world's</p>",
  "page-1715": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">literature\nbut directly from the torrid, scented plains and the bleak mountains of\ntheir country. A few short months now, and he would hear with his own ears\nall around him the language which seemed most apt for grandeur of soul and\npassion. His fine taste had given him an inkling that Andalusia was too\nsoft and sensuous, a little vulgar even, to satisfy his ardour; and his\nimagination dwelt more willingly among the wind-swept distances of Castile\nand the rugged magnificence of Aragon and Leon. He did not know quite what\nthose unknown contacts would give him, but he felt that he would gather\nfrom them a strength and a purpose which would make him more capable of\naffronting and comprehending the manifold wonders of places more distant\nand more strange.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For this was only a beginning. He had got into communication with the\nvarious companies which took surgeons out on their ships, and knew exactly\nwhat were</p>",
  "page-1716": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">their routes, and from men who had been on them what were the\nadvantages and disadvantages of each line. He put aside the Orient and the\nP. & O. It was difficult to get a berth with them; and besides their\npassenger traffic allowed the medical officer little freedom; but there\nwere other services which sent large tramps on leisurely expeditions to\nthe East, stopping at all sorts of ports for various periods, from a day\nor two to a fortnight, so that you had plenty of time, and it was often\npossible to make a trip inland. The pay was poor and the food no more than\nadequate, so that there was not much demand for the posts, and a man with\na London degree was pretty sure to get one if he applied. Since there were\nno passengers other than a casual man or so, shipping on business from\nsome out-of-the-way port to another, the life on board was friendly and\npleasant. Philip knew by heart the list of places at which they touched;\nand each one called up in him visions of</p>",
  "page-1717": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">tropical sunshine, and magic\ncolour, and of a teeming, mysterious, intense life. Life! That was what he\nwanted. At last he would come to close quarters with Life. And perhaps,\nfrom Tokyo or Shanghai it would be possible to tranship into some other\nline and drip down to the islands of the South Pacific. A doctor was\nuseful anywhere. There might be an opportunity to go up country in Burmah,\nand what rich jungles in Sumatra or Borneo might he not visit? He was\nyoung still and time was no object to him. He had no ties in England, no\nfriends; he could go up and down the world for years, learning the beauty\nand the wonder and the variedness of life.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now this thing had come. He put aside the possibility that Sally was\nmistaken; he felt strangely certain that she was right; after all, it was\nso likely; anyone could see that Nature had built her to be the mother of\nchildren. He knew what he ought to do. He</p>",
  "page-1718": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">ought not to let the incident\ndivert him a hair's breadth from his path. He thought of Griffiths; he\ncould easily imagine with what indifference that young man would have\nreceived such a piece of news; he would have thought it an awful nuisance\nand would at once have taken to his heels, like a wise fellow; he would\nhave left the girl to deal with her troubles as best she could. Philip\ntold himself that if this had happened it was because it was inevitable.\nHe was no more to blame than Sally; she was a girl who knew the world and\nthe facts of life, and she had taken the risk with her eyes open. It would\nbe madness to allow such an accident to disturb the whole pattern of his\nlife. He was one of the few people who was acutely conscious of the\ntransitoriness of life, and how necessary it was to make the most of it.\nHe would do what he could for Sally; he could afford to give her a\nsufficient sum of money. A strong man would never allow himself to be\nturned</p>",
  "page-1719": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">from his purpose.</p><p>Philip said all this to himself, but he knew he could not do it. He simply\ncould not. He knew himself.</p><p>\"I'm so damned weak,\" he muttered despairingly.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She had trusted him and been kind to him. He simply could not do a thing\nwhich, notwithstanding all his reason, he felt was horrible. He knew he\nwould have no peace on his travels if he had the thought constantly with\nhim that she was wretched. Besides, there were her father and mother: they\nhad always treated him well; it was not possible to repay them with\ningratitude. The only thing was to marry Sally as quickly as possible. He\nwould write to Doctor South, tell him he was going to be married at once,\nand say that if his offer still held he was willing to accept it. That\nsort of practice, among poor people, was the only one possible for him;\nthere his deformity did not matter, and they would not sneer at the simple\nmanners of his wife. It was curious to</p>",
  "page-1720": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">think of her as his wife, it gave\nhim a queer, soft feeling; and a wave of emotion spread over him as he\nthought of the child which was his. He had little doubt that Doctor South\nwould be glad to have him, and he pictured to himself the life he would\nlead with Sally in the fishing village. They would have a little house\nwithin sight of the sea, and he would watch the mighty ships passing to\nthe lands he would never know. Perhaps that was the wisest thing. Cronshaw\nhad told him that the facts of life mattered nothing to him who by the\npower of fancy held in fee the twin realms of space and time. It was true.\nForever wilt thou love and she be fair!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">His wedding present to his wife would be all his high hopes.\nSelf-sacrifice! Philip was uplifted by its beauty, and all through the\nevening he thought of it. He was so excited that he could not read. He\nseemed to be driven out of his rooms into the streets, and he walked up\nand down Birdcage Walk, his heart throbbing with joy. He</p>",
  "page-1721": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">could hardly bear\nhis impatience. He wanted to see Sally's happiness when he made her his\noffer, and if it had not been so late he would have gone to her there and\nthen. He pictured to himself the long evenings he would spend with Sally\nin the cosy sitting-room, the blinds undrawn so that they could watch the\nsea; he with his books, while she bent over her work, and the shaded lamp\nmade her sweet face more fair. They would talk over the growing child, and\nwhen she turned her eyes to his there was in them the light of love. And\nthe fishermen and their wives who were his patients would come to feel a\ngreat affection for them, and they in their turn would enter into the\npleasures and pains of those simple lives. But his thoughts returned to\nthe son who would be his and hers. Already he felt in himself a passionate\ndevotion to it. He thought of passing his hands over his little perfect\nlimbs, he knew he would be beautiful; and he would make over to him all\nhis dreams</p>",
  "page-1722": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">of a rich and varied life. And thinking over the long\npilgrimage of his past he accepted it joyfully. He accepted the deformity\nwhich had made life so hard for him; he knew that it had warped his\ncharacter, but now he saw also that by reason of it he had acquired that\npower of introspection which had given him so much delight. Without it he\nwould never have had his keen appreciation of beauty, his passion for art\nand literature, and his interest in the varied spectacle of life. The\nridicule and the contempt which had so often been heaped upon him had\nturned his mind inward and called forth those flowers which he felt would\nnever lose their fragrance. Then he saw that the normal was the rarest\nthing in the world. Everyone had some defect, of body or of mind: he\nthought of all the people he had known (the whole world was like a\nsick-house, and there was no rhyme or reason in it), he saw a long\nprocession, deformed in body and warped in mind,</p>",

He could pardon Griffiths for his treachery and Mildred for the\npain she had caused him. They could not help themselves.

It was because he rejoiced in\nthe feeling that he had not attempted to see her. He had repeated to\nhimself exactly what he would say to her and how he should say it.

He thought of Sally, with her\nkind blue eyes; and his lips unconsciously formed themselves into a smile.\nHe walked up the steps of the National Gallery and sat down in the first\nroom, so that he should see her the moment she came in. It always\ncomforted him to get among pictures. He looked at none in particular, but\nallowed the magnificence of their colour, the beauty of their lines, to\nwork upon his soul. His imagination was busy with Sally. It would be\npleasant to take her away from that London in which she seemed an unusual\nfigure, like a cornflower in a shop among orchids and azaleas; he had\nlearned in the Kentish hop-field that she</p>",
  "page-1727": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">did not belong to the town; and\nhe was sure that she would blossom under the soft skies of Dorset to a\nrarer beauty. She came in, and he got up to meet her. She was in black,\nwith white cuffs at her wrists and a lawn collar round her neck. They\nshook hands.</p><p>\"Have you been waiting long?\"</p><p>\"No. Ten minutes. Are you hungry?\"</p><p>\"Not very.\"</p><p>\"Let's sit here for a bit, shall we?\"</p><p>\"If you like.\"</p><p>They sat quietly, side by side, without speaking. Philip enjoyed having\nher near him. He was warmed by her radiant health. A glow of life seemed\nlike an aureole to shine about her.</p><p>\"Well, how have you been?\" he said at last, with a little smile.</p><p>\"Oh, it's all right. It was a false alarm.\"</p><p>\"Was it?\"</p>",
  "page-1728": "<p>\"Aren't you glad?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">An extraordinary sensation filled him. He had felt certain that Sally's\nsuspicion was well-founded; it had never occurred to him for an instant\nthat there was a possibility of error. All his plans were suddenly\noverthrown, and the existence, so elaborately pictured, was no more than\na dream which would never be realised. He was free once more. Free! He\nneed give up none of his projects, and life still was in his hands for him\nto do what he liked with. He felt no exhilaration, but only dismay. His\nheart sank. The future stretched out before him in desolate emptiness. It\nwas as though he had sailed for many years over a great waste of waters,\nwith peril and privation, and at last had come upon a fair haven, but as\nhe was about to enter, some contrary wind had arisen and drove him out\nagain into the open sea; and because he had let his mind dwell on these\nsoft meads and pleasant woods of the land, the vast deserts</p>",
  "page-1729": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of the ocean\nfilled him with anguish. He could not confront again the loneliness and\nthe tempest. Sally looked at him with her clear eyes.</p><p>\"Aren't you glad?\" she asked again. \"I thought you'd be as pleased as\nPunch.\"</p><p>He met her gaze haggardly. \"I'm not sure,\" he muttered.</p><p>\"You are funny. Most men would.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He realised that he had deceived himself; it was no self-sacrifice that\nhad driven him to think of marrying, but the desire for a wife and a home\nand love; and now that it all seemed to slip through his fingers he was\nseized with despair. He wanted all that more than anything in the world.\nWhat did he care for Spain and its cities, Cordova, Toledo, Leon; what to\nhim were the pagodas of Burmah and the lagoons of South Sea Islands?\nAmerica was here and now. It seemed to him that all his life he had\nfollowed the ideals that other</p>",
  "page-1730": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">people, by their words or their writings,\nhad instilled into him, and never the desires of his own heart. Always his\ncourse had been swayed by what he thought he should do and never by what\nhe wanted with his whole soul to do. He put all that aside now with a\ngesture of impatience. He had lived always in the future, and the present\nalways, always had slipped through his fingers. His ideals? He thought of\nhis desire to make a design, intricate and beautiful, out of the myriad,\nmeaningless facts of life: had he not seen also that the simplest pattern,\nthat in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died, was\nlikewise the most perfect? It might be that to surrender to happiness was\nto accept defeat, but it was a defeat better than many victories.</p><p>He glanced quickly at Sally, he wondered what she was thinking, and then\nlooked away again.</p><p>\"I was going to ask you to marry me,\" he said.</p>",
  "page-1731": "<p>\"I thought p'raps you might, but I shouldn't have liked to stand in your\nway.\"</p><p>\"You wouldn't have done that.\"</p><p>\"How about your travels, Spain and all that?\"</p><p>\"How d'you know I want to travel?\"</p><p>\"I ought to know something about it. I've heard you and Dad talk about it\ntill you were blue in the face.\"</p><p>\"I don't care a damn about all that.\" He paused for an instant and then\nspoke in a low, hoarse whisper. \"I don't want to leave you! I can't leave\nyou.\"</p><p>She did not answer. He could not tell what she thought.</p><p>\"I wonder if you'll marry me, Sally.\"</p><p>She did not move and there was no flicker of emotion on her face, but she\ndid not look at him when she answered.</p><p>\"If you like.\"</p><p>\"Don't you want to?\"</p>",
  "page-1732": "<p>\"Oh, of course I'd like to have a house of my own, and it's about time I\nwas settling down.\"</p><p>He smiled a little. He knew her pretty well by now, and her manner did not\nsurprise him.</p><p>\"But don't you want to marry ME?\"</p><p>\"There's no one else I would marry.\"</p><p>\"Then that settles it.\"</p><p>\"Mother and Dad will be surprised, won't they?\"</p><p>\"I'm so happy.\"</p><p>\"I want my lunch,\" she said.</p><p>\"Dear!\"</p><p>He smiled and took her hand and pressed it. They got up and walked out of\nthe gallery. They stood for a moment at the balustrade and looked at\nTrafalgar Square. Cabs and omnibuses hurried to and fro, and crowds\npassed, hastening in every direction, and the sun was shining.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
